4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:17,147
>> Welcome to Stanford CS193P,
this is
winter quarter 2015.

5
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:21,718
And we're gonna dive right in
today to
some brief slide work.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,221
This people at Stanford, you've
got a
document that describe,

7
00:00:26,223 --> 00:00:28,357
describes all the grading and
all that
stuff so

8
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,126
I'm not gonna go over that in
lecture like
I often do to start the quarter.

9
00:00:33,663 --> 00:00:36,296
Instead I'm gonna talk a little
bit about,
what this class is about.

10
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:42,068
Brief mention of the
prerequisites cuz
they're pretty important in this
class.

11
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,870
Then just the [NOISE] quickest
overview of
iOS.

12
00:00:44,872 --> 00:00:49,508
I'm gonna assume that anyone who
is here
or is watching this, knows what
that is.

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,609
And then, we're gonna dive right
into a
big old demo.

14
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:54,779
It's gonna be a two-day thing,
where I'm
really going to try and

15
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:57,381
introduce you to Xcode and the
development
environment and

16
00:00:57,383 --> 00:01:01,818
this language Swift, that you're
gonna
have to learn to develop for
iOS.

17
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,120
All right, so what is this class
about?

18
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:06,455
It's about building cool apps,
as we know.

19
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:09,091
Why are these iOS apps so cool?

20
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:11,960
Well, because the device you're
gonna run
them on is in your pocket or

21
00:01:11,962 --> 00:01:14,229
in your backpack.

22
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,497
Either, if you write an app, you
can just
pull it out and show your
friends and

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,535
it's highly networked and
incredible
graphics with animation.

24
00:01:20,537 --> 00:01:23,371
It's just cool all the way
around and I
think you guys all know that or

25
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:24,605
you wouldn't be here.

26
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:26,490
But you're also gonna learn in

27
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,374
this class a lot of real life
Object-Oriented Programming.

28
00:01:28,377 --> 00:01:32,578
You're taking a lot of other
classes here
at Stanford on things like
graphics, and

29
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,849
networking, and databases, and
maybe
animation.

30
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:39,718
Things like that.

31
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,586
And we're gonna is kinda tie
that all
together into a real world
class.

32
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:44,055
'Kay?
You're gonna get to see all this
stuff.

33
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:46,891
Now, you know, it's gonna be
kind of a
survey course in that,

34
00:01:46,893 --> 00:01:49,426
I can't go too deep into
networking.

35
00:01:49,428 --> 00:01:52,462
I can't go too deep into
databases.

36
00:01:52,464 --> 00:01:56,366
I can't go too deep into
animation, but
you'll get to see it all in a
really real

37
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:59,569
world environment, where people
out there
building apps using that
technology.

38
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:03,906
For some of you who haven't seen
that
before that'll be a big bonus of

39
00:02:03,908 --> 00:02:04,940
this class, I think.

40
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:07,975
The prerequisites of this class.

41
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:11,712
Number one thing is you have to
be a
pretty strong Object-Oriented
programmer.

42
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,014
If you're not a strong
Object-Oriented
programmer, and

43
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:18,018
you hit this class, you're
probably gonna
go under water, pretty quick.

44
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,519
Okay?
I'm gonna assume you know,

45
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:22,188
everything about Object-Oriented
Programming.

46
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,456
IOS is a completely
Object-Oriented
Programming envir,

47
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,658
development environment,

48
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:28,859
I just don't mean I'm not just
talking
about the language is
Object-Oriented.

49
00:02:28,862 --> 00:02:31,863
But the entire design of it the
way you
use it if you're not

50
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:33,965
comfortable with things like
subclassing
and

51
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:37,935
stuff like that then you're just
really
gonna be behind the curve.

52
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:42,239
In iOS so at Stanford here that
means
CS16A and B or

53
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:47,344
CS16X, and then you know, CS107,
while
it's not really Object-Oriented
course,

54
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:49,746
at least it's a heavy duty
programming
course.

55
00:02:49,748 --> 00:02:52,615
CS108 is a great Object-Oriented
course so

56
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:55,918
if you have, if you've taken
CS108 you'll
probably, be really well
prepped.

57
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,555
110, again not really too much
an
Object-Oriented program but

58
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:03,057
good programming course cuz
there's a lot
of programming in this class,

59
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:05,159
in fact, all the work in this
class is
programming.

60
00:03:05,161 --> 00:03:08,395
You will not have, a little bit
of reading
the first couple of weeks just
to

61
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:12,299
kinda learn this new language,
but it's
almost all programming after
that all

62
00:03:12,301 --> 00:03:14,467
the way til the end, including
your final
project.

63
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:17,804
So if you're not really
comfortable with
all these terms,

64
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:21,674
this Object-Oriented terms or if
you're
just not really comfortable with

65
00:03:21,676 --> 00:03:26,178
writing big programs then this
class will
definitely be a challenge for
you.

66
00:03:27,848 --> 00:03:30,682
okay, so what's in iOS, what are
the parts
of it?

67
00:03:30,684 --> 00:03:34,085
You know, it's ha, it's such a
big system,
it's got so much in it.

68
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:36,170
It's impossible for me to,

69
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:38,254
like, encapsulate it into a
small little
summary but.

70
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:42,659
I do have this slide right here
that
divides it into these four
layers.

71
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:46,763
These four layers are
approximately down
near the hardware at the bottom.

72
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:48,264
Up near the user at the top.

73
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:48,964
Okay?

74
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:52,284
So at the bottom, so

75
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:55,603
a lot of people don't realize
that iOS is
basically a Unix-based operating
system.

76
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:57,772
'Kay?
It's very similar shares a lot
of

77
00:03:57,774 --> 00:03:59,206
the core of Mac OS 10.

78
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,559
Okay?

79
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,911
Now, it's certainly optimized
for mobile
devices, which have

80
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:08,748
battery restrictions and things
like that,
but that is basically what it
is.

81
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,517
And so down at that layer you've
got
sockets, and

82
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,121
you've got you know,
permissions, and
things like that,

83
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:19,191
that have to be near the oh you
know,
hardware to, to work properly.

84
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:23,495
But above that there's kind of
an
Object-Oriented layer that lets
you get at

85
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,731
a lot of that stuff using
Object-Oriented
Programming.

86
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:30,234
'Kay?
And this stuff is not UI
oriented it's

87
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:34,171
more kind of accessing the
hardware
through Object-Oriented
Programming or

88
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,373
accessing networking through
Object-Oriented Programming but

89
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,309
it's a big layer there and so we
will
spend a fair amount of

90
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:44,980
time in this layer because we
need those
primitives to build at the
higher layers.

91
00:04:44,982 --> 00:04:48,450
Then, there's this whole layer,
which I
wish we had more time to spend
on.

92
00:04:48,452 --> 00:04:50,252
We only get ten weeks in this
whole class.

93
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:53,321
It goes by so fast, you'll be
amazed, as
you're probably,

94
00:04:53,323 --> 00:04:54,655
used to with your Stanford
courses.

95
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:58,092
But there's a whole media layer
here, both
for

96
00:04:58,094 --> 00:05:02,062
static images, as you know, JPEG
and
things like that.

97
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:07,700
And video both capturing video,
editing
video, all that.

98
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:11,404
Incredible audio, the frameworks
on this
device for

99
00:05:11,406 --> 00:05:13,706
doing 3D audio for games and all
that.

100
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,675
I get to, unfortunately I get to
very
little of this layer.

101
00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:20,879
But I'll try to let you know,
that it's in
there and then you'll know to go
out and

102
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:23,948
seek out, if you're building a
very audio
intensive app or

103
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,484
video intensive app, you'll seek
out that
layer.

104
00:05:26,486 --> 00:05:32,756
But we'll spend the vast
majority of our
time at the Cocoa Touch layer.

105
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:35,325
So the Cocoa Touch layer, that's
where the
buttons and

106
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:38,895
sliders and things like that are
it's the
layer,

107
00:05:38,897 --> 00:05:43,032
where you're gonna build the
interactivity
with your end user.

108
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:46,135
And so, that's where we probably
spend 70
plus percent of

109
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,936
our time in the Cocoa Touch
layer.

110
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:50,271
And this is a very powerful
layer.

111
00:05:50,273 --> 00:05:54,809
You know, you've seen things
like the maps
app on the phone.

112
00:05:54,811 --> 00:05:58,346
There's basically, an object
that does
almost the entire maps app, that
you can

113
00:05:58,348 --> 00:06:01,482
just drop right into your
program, and now
you have maps in your program.

114
00:06:01,484 --> 00:06:04,051
Same thing with web browser.

115
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:06,619
If you wanna put web browsing in
your app,
it's just boom, pop an object in
there,

116
00:06:06,622 --> 00:06:08,655
call a couple methods and in
your, on your
way.

117
00:06:08,657 --> 00:06:13,592
So very powerful, very high
level in
there's a lot going on in there
and

118
00:06:13,594 --> 00:06:16,195
that's where we will spend most
of our
time, 'kay?

119
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:19,831
And by the way, if you have any
questions
I try to glance up, so

120
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,499
the bright lights over there
sometimes in
my way,

121
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:25,302
but, shout out or you know,
otherwise get
my attention.

122
00:06:25,304 --> 00:06:28,105
If you feel free to interrupt.

123
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:29,806
Then there's the development
platform
itself.

124
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:31,308
'Kay?

125
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:32,809
With the tools we use to build
these iOS
apps.

126
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:34,978
What's in that?

127
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,146
Well, it's all pretty much now
been
funneled into this one

128
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:39,048
application called Xcode 6.

129
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,418
There are some little adjuncts
that it
calls out to but

130
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,287
Xcode 6 is everything, it's your
code
editor,

131
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:50,024
it's your compiler, your
debugger all of
that in one, pretty awesome app.

132
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:54,395
And so we'll be learning all
about Xcode 6
in this class, and

133
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:59,366
that's where you'll be spend all
your time
developing, you're not gonna be
at

134
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:04,337
a terminal typing in Emacs or
something,
you're gonna be in Xcode 6.

135
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:08,874
Languages I have there's
actually, two
languages in iOS now.

136
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:12,044
There are peers that you can
pretty much
use either one.

137
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:14,079
One of them is called
Objective-C,

138
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:17,715
that's the language that iOS was
originally developed for.

139
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:22,553
It's a language been around a
long time,
probably 30 years it's been
around or 25

140
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:27,123
to 30 years that's it's actually
been used
to build stuff that's on the Mac
today.

141
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:32,194
So, it's very mature language
but it's
also 25, 30 years old.

142
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:36,965
And so Apple last summer
introduced a
completely new language called
Swift, and

143
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:40,669
Swift, you can do pretty much
everything
in iOS with Swift and

144
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:45,172
that's the language we're gonna
learn
because it's a modern language.

145
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:48,709
Apple did a great job of kind
of, building
all the best stuff of

146
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:52,346
all the languages that have been
invented
over the last, you know,

147
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:57,684
25 years of this especially the
last five
or ten years into this language.

148
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:02,988
It's very concise it's a very
type safe
language but has type inference
and a lot

149
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,991
of things that make it so that
you get the
best of both worlds by having
type safety-

150
00:08:06,993 --> 00:08:08,292
>> [COUGH]
>> And not have to

151
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:11,295
be constantly over specifying
everything.

152
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:14,665
So we're gonna go Swift only,
I'm not even
gonna really talk about
Objective-C,

153
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:16,400
I just don't have time to do
both
languages.

154
00:08:16,402 --> 00:08:19,786
Yeah.
>> [INAUDIBLE] This is

155
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:23,171
a [INAUDIBLE] course [INAUDIBLE]
[COUGH]
[INAUDIBLE] doing iOS
development.

156
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:26,275
>> Yeah, so the question is if
I'm going
out into the world to do

157
00:08:26,277 --> 00:08:29,244
iOS development in the real
world for real
companies.

158
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:30,912
Am I probably, gonna have to
learn
Objective-C?

159
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:34,049
And the answer is [NOISE] it
depends on
the company you're at.

160
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:36,017
Probably in the short term, yes.

161
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:39,920
But as the time goes by
probably, more and
more people switch to siff,
Swift.

162
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:43,490
>> [COUGH]
>> The good thing is the
underlying iOS

163
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:45,926
APIs are exactly the same for
both, its
just the syntax-

164
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:49,162
>> [COUGH]
>> Of the language a little bit

165
00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:52,397
about how the language
approaches calling
the API is slightly different,
but any,

166
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,734
everything that you learn in
here about
the underlying,

167
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:57,636
lying parts of iOS will totally
work in
Objective-C.

168
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,571
All the methods are the same you
know,

169
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:00,939
it's just the syntax is a little
different.

170
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,540
>> [COUGH]
>> So, don't feel too bad about
not

171
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,276
learning both languages, and
once you've
learned this language,

172
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,911
learning Objective-C is gonna be
pretty
easy, too.

173
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:10,414
So.
Good question though.

174
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,815
All right.

175
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,617
Of course iOS is filled with
tons of
frameworks.

176
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:18,320
Frameworks are libraries,
basically, of
objects that you use,

177
00:09:18,322 --> 00:09:20,989
as building blocks to build your
application.

178
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:23,325
And we are going to be covering
them.

179
00:09:23,327 --> 00:09:25,193
UIKit is the main one.

180
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:27,829
It's got most of the user
interface stuff
in it.

181
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:32,266
Foundation is that most the
course
services layer that I was
talking about,

182
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:37,070
and but there's tons of other
ones, core
motion for doing the, the device
moving

183
00:09:37,072 --> 00:09:42,075
around, you know, gyro and
accelerometer,
core data for Object-Oriented
database.

184
00:09:42,077 --> 00:09:44,961
Things like that.

185
00:09:44,962 --> 00:09:47,846
So I'll get to, as many as those
as I can,
especially the big ones.

186
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:50,849
But there's just way too many to
cover in
ten weeks.

187
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:53,884
And finally we I, I put this,

188
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:58,188
as a first class thing with all
the rest,
as a design strategy MVC.

189
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,124
I think, I usually ask, I'll all
ask this
year, too.

190
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:05,361
How many people have used MVC in
some
other class?

191
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:07,196
See, so it's half of you.

192
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:09,698
So I'll be teaching MVC, as if
you don't
know it, so

193
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,599
if you don't know it don't
worry.

194
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:15,636
But MVC is a way of designing
your
application so that it's a
little more

195
00:10:15,638 --> 00:10:21,141
debuggable, reusable
understandable to you
and to anyone reading your code.

196
00:10:21,143 --> 00:10:25,278
And iOS was designed with MVC
from the
start.

197
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,214
So it's just integral part to
building an
iOS.

198
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:33,452
Now, I'm gonna do the demo
today, and on
Wednesday I'm kinda not gonna
follow MVC.

199
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:37,922
But then next Monday we're gonna
apply MVC
to the demo I'm doing today and

200
00:10:37,924 --> 00:10:41,426
Wednesday, so you're gonna get
the full
MVC treatment there.

201
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:45,262
And I'll be having some slides
on MVC on
Wednesday to prepare you for
next Monday.

202
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:49,699
Okay?
All right, so here's the demo.

203
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:51,818
The demo I'm gonna do,

204
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,936
is something I actually did a
few years
ago that really works well-

205
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:55,971
>> [COUGH]
>> With Swift, which is a
calculator.

206
00:10:55,973 --> 00:10:57,373
So, we're gonna build this
calculator.

207
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,509
And we're gonna build it from
scratch, all
the way.

208
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:04,545
And I like to do my demos, where
I only
type in stuff, I don't copy and

209
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:06,914
paste big chunks of code in or
whatever.

210
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,817
I know, I'd see a lot of laptops
open, a
lot of people like to try and

211
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:12,736
follow along with me.

212
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:15,654
I'm a fast typer, but usually in
most
demos you can keep, keep up if
you want.

213
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:20,426
I don't recommend it
necessarily, or
certainly I don't require it.

214
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:25,197
I am going to, you, you'll be
able to go
back and

215
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:28,400
watch this particular demo on
video.

216
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:30,535
Even Stanford people will be
able to do
that.

217
00:11:30,537 --> 00:11:34,805
Because your first assignment is
gonna be
to reproduce what I do.

218
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:37,041
'Kay?
That is 90% of your first
assignment.

219
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:40,277
Reproduce what I'm gonna do,
today and on
Wednesday.

220
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,946
So I'm not gonna post the code
because I
want you to go through the
experience of

221
00:11:42,948 --> 00:11:45,615
typing the code in, and if you
watch in on
video,

222
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:50,119
watching what I do again, and
and typing
it all in.

223
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:51,219
>> [COUGH] 'Kay?

224
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:52,821
And I'll explain that all on
Wednesday.

225
00:11:54,457 --> 00:11:56,340
Okay?

226
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,224
So, I put on the slide a bunch
of things
that I'm gonna cover, but I'm
not gonna go

227
00:11:58,227 --> 00:12:01,628
over it in advance, I'm just
gonna sit,
sit and soon I'll start doing
it.

228
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,498
So any questions before I dive
in here?

229
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,401
I know we're gonna little fast,
but I
wanna maximize your learning
time.

230
00:12:08,403 --> 00:12:11,870
[INAUDIBLE]
[NOISE].

231
00:12:11,872 --> 00:12:12,771
Direct of what?

232
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,706
Recommendation to which Xcode-

233
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:18,142
So the questions, which Xcode
should we
use, should you use?

234
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:20,811
Well, you should just use the
one on the
Mac App store.

235
00:12:20,813 --> 00:12:23,247
So, just go to the Mac App
store, it's
free.

236
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:25,482
Use the one there, whatever the
latest one
is.

237
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:28,618
If a new one comes out in the
quarter,
well, let's all switch over to
it.

238
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,620
Okay, let's just always be using
the
latest Xcode.

239
00:12:30,622 --> 00:12:31,354
'Kay any-

240
00:12:31,356 --> 00:12:32,621
[INAUDIBLE] Beta [INAUDIBLE] No.

241
00:12:32,623 --> 00:12:33,855
Not.
We're not gonna using a beta or

242
00:12:33,857 --> 00:12:35,624
anything like that.

243
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,392
We'll just use whatever the
currently
published Xcode is.

244
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:41,746
Okay.

245
00:12:41,747 --> 00:12:44,498
So, I'm going to start this demo
actually
by launching Xcode.

246
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,265
So, here it is, right here.

247
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:50,669
Xcode.

248
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,270
And when you launch Xcode, let's
hide
others here.

249
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,140
You're gonna get this splash
screen and

250
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:58,376
on this splash screen on the
right, this
is gonna be all your projects.

251
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,711
Now, since it's the beginning of
the
quarter, we don't have any
projects yet,

252
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,048
but they'll all be listed here,
so as the
quarter goes by this will fill
up.

253
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,284
You can turn this splash screen
off, if
you don't like it by the way.

254
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,820
This splash screen also lets us
do things
like playgrounds and

255
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:13,256
a source code management right
down here.

256
00:13:13,258 --> 00:13:15,024
We're not gonna be doing that
for a while.

257
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:16,859
We're gonna be focusing on this
option,
right here.

258
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:18,760
Create a new Xcode project.

259
00:13:18,762 --> 00:13:22,463
If you don't have the splash
screen, you
can go to File > New > Project.

260
00:13:22,465 --> 00:13:23,748
Kay.

261
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:25,032
Same thing, those both the same
thing.

262
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:28,469
So I'm gonna click right here on
Create a
new project.

263
00:13:28,471 --> 00:13:31,605
When I create a new project, it
wants to
know what kind of project you
want to

264
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:35,908
create, because Xcode is
actually used on
Mac OS 10 and to build
frameworks and

265
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,494
all that stuff.

266
00:13:38,495 --> 00:13:41,079
But we're always gonna be
building iOS
Applications.

267
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:43,382
And in fact, we're always gonna
use this
template right here,

268
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:44,783
Single View Application.

269
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:47,236
'Kay?

270
00:13:47,237 --> 00:13:49,688
That's kind of your basic MVC
starter
application and

271
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,724
we're gonna build very
complicated apps
out of that, but we're gonna
start here,

272
00:13:53,726 --> 00:13:55,592
so you always click on that one.

273
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:58,528
Then it wants to know what you
want to
call your app, and

274
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,598
we're building a calculator, so
we're
gonna call our app, Calculator.

275
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,634
'Kay?

276
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,669
This organization name doesn't
really
matter that's just gonna appear
in

277
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:10,339
copyright notice and the code
that you
write at the top in a comment so

278
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:12,291
don't worry about that.

279
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:14,242
But this organization identifier
that is
very important.

280
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:17,611
'Kay, this uniquely identifies
you.

281
00:14:17,613 --> 00:14:19,230
Okay?

282
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:20,848
So that on the next line we can
you just,

283
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,950
new uniquely idefy, identify
your
calculator.

284
00:14:23,952 --> 00:14:26,219
So here if your a Stanford
student,

285
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:31,490
you'll wanna use this reverse
DNS notation
here edu.stanford.cs1983p.

286
00:14:31,492 --> 00:14:35,093
And instead of instructor there,
you wanna
put your SU net ID.

287
00:14:35,095 --> 00:14:36,661
'Kay?

288
00:14:36,663 --> 00:14:37,929
Cuz nobody else has that but
you.

289
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:39,864
And that'll uniquely identify
you.

290
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,201
As I said, we're using Swift not
Objective-C.

291
00:14:44,203 --> 00:14:49,272
And we're gonna build an app
that works
be, equally well on iPad and

292
00:14:49,274 --> 00:14:51,507
iPhone, that's called a
universal app.

293
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:54,209
You can pick to develop for only
one or
the other.

294
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:56,745
But we are going to go universal
here.

295
00:14:56,747 --> 00:15:00,248
We're not gonna really be doing
the iPad
part of it for a couple weeks.

296
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,352
But it is our intent to
eventually build
an app that works on both.

297
00:15:04,354 --> 00:15:06,186
Okay we're not going to be using
core
data,

298
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:09,322
that's object oriented database
stuff so
you just leave that unchecked.

299
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:13,993
And now it's asking where we
want to save
it, I strongly recommend saving
in your

300
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:18,998
home directory, this is my home
directory
here in a folder called
Developer, okay?

301
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,001
You could put other folders in
here if you
want to arrange it more,

302
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:25,103
but home directory Developer, I
highly
recommend that.

303
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:28,273
Source control, we will be
talking about
that at some point in the
quarter but

304
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:30,141
we're not gonna do it right off
the bat
here so

305
00:15:30,143 --> 00:15:31,776
you can leave that unchecked as
well.

306
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:37,847
All right, so here's our first
project,
its been created so

307
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:43,586
this is Xcode that your seeing
right here,
this is Xcode's main screen and

308
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:46,955
the center is really what your
working on.

309
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:51,026
The left is, area here, is
called the
navigator, and the navigator
you,

310
00:15:51,028 --> 00:15:54,829
you use to kind of choose what
you're
working on but you can also do

311
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:59,367
things over here like search
though your
whole project, that's this
little guy.

312
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:04,838
Look at all your break points
maybe, look
at previous builds that you've
done,

313
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,076
browse your project by class
hierarchy,
all that stuff.

314
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:12,312
But we're usually on the left
most one
here which is just all of the
files in

315
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:17,750
your project which can also can
be
organized hierarchically like
this.

316
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:19,585
And when you select something
here on the
left,

317
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:23,588
the middle will fill up with
what that
you've selected so.

318
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,591
Here I have the actual project
itself
selected.

319
00:16:26,593 --> 00:16:28,993
So these are the project
settings of which
there are tons.

320
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:31,662
All along the top here you can
see tons of
settings.

321
00:16:31,664 --> 00:16:34,431
We're, we'll go through them as
the
quarter goes on and

322
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:37,100
you've already seen some of them
like the
bundle identifier there and

323
00:16:37,102 --> 00:16:38,702
the fact this is a universal
app.

324
00:16:38,704 --> 00:16:41,037
We're not going to talk about
anymore of
this today,

325
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,805
this project settings business.

326
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:45,107
We're gonna focus here on some
of these
files.

327
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:47,409
And even some of these files,
like this
AppDelegate,

328
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:50,845
I'm just gonna move that down to
Supporting Files to get it out
of the way.

329
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:53,081
Same things with these image
assets,

330
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:56,117
LaunchScreen well get to this
later in the
quarter.

331
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:58,285
But I wanna focus on these two
files right
here.

332
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:03,957
Okay Main.storyboard and
ViewController.swift, okay?

333
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,192
In the MVC world by the way,
this is the
V,

334
00:17:06,194 --> 00:17:10,896
the view and this is the C, the
controller
but we will talk about MVC on
Wednesday.

335
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:13,665
So what do these things contain?

336
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:16,234
So this Main.storyboard, if I
click on it,

337
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,936
you see it appear in the middle,
this is
our UI.

338
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,972
Okay, this is our user
interface.

339
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:23,973
So for a calculator this is
going to be a
little display,

340
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,811
this shows the number that we're
working
on or whatever at the top.

341
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:32,448
And lots of buttons down here,
number
buttons, times, multi, or sorry,
times,

342
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,917
divide, plus, minus, square
root.

343
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:36,451
That's all going to be here.

344
00:17:36,453 --> 00:17:39,521
So we're going to build this
entire user
interface.

345
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:41,055
Purely graphically.

346
00:17:41,057 --> 00:17:43,057
Okay?
We're not gonna be writing code.

347
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:45,259
Put button at this location.

348
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:47,411
None of that, okay?

349
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:49,562
We just literally with our mouse
are gonna
build this whole user interface.

350
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:53,700
So what's the code, what do we
need any
code for?

351
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:57,203
Well, we, this
ViewController.swift, this
is a Swift file.

352
00:17:57,205 --> 00:18:00,539
This is your first look at Swift
for most
of you.

353
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,108
This controller is gonna control
that user
interface.

354
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,877
That's why we call it the view
controller
or the controller.

355
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:09,180
It controls user interface and
that means
it's gonna do things that

356
00:18:09,182 --> 00:18:13,651
are specific to how this user
interface, a
calculator's user interface,
works.

357
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:16,720
So when we press the digit
buttons, it's
going to have update the
display.

358
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:19,856
When we press times, it's gonna
have to do
some multiplication and

359
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:21,524
then put the result in the
display.

360
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:24,227
So it's controlling the display.

361
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:28,597
Okay so we'll get back to this
code in a
moment but we're gonna start by

362
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:33,802
building our user interface and
by the
way, your user interface, you
can see I

363
00:18:33,804 --> 00:18:39,140
have a low resolution screen
here so my UI
doesn't even really fit in the
space here.

364
00:18:39,142 --> 00:18:42,677
You'll probably have maybe a
little higher
resolution screen then I do but

365
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:45,979
if you don't, you can zoom in
and out, I'm
just right-clicking,

366
00:18:45,981 --> 00:18:49,516
if you right-click on the
background area
here, you can zoom in and out.

367
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:52,652
You can also do it by
double-clicking so
if I double-click on this,

368
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:56,122
it zooms it to normal, if I
double-click
on the background, it zooms out
so

369
00:18:56,124 --> 00:18:57,523
that way I can see my whole UI.

370
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:59,992
Now when we build a complicated
app,

371
00:18:59,994 --> 00:19:05,663
we're gonna have a whole bunch
of these
little square areas, we call
these scenes,

372
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:11,402
and a scene represents kind of
phone full,
phone screen full of
information.

373
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:15,072
Okay and as you you've used many
iOS
applications, you know that you

374
00:19:15,074 --> 00:19:20,443
transition from one screen to
another as
the user goes through the app
and

375
00:19:20,445 --> 00:19:22,111
that's how your gonna build your
apps as
well.

376
00:19:22,113 --> 00:19:25,981
And this storyboard is
eventually gonna
have a big map showing all

377
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:28,951
the transitions between all
those scenes.

378
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:31,019
Okay, so this storyboard is
gonna get big
for

379
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:35,323
big apps, your really gonna see
your whole
application which is kinda cool.

380
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,893
So we're gonna start small
though, just
this one little screen right
here.

381
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:41,361
Which is gonna be our
calculator.

382
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:44,864
So let's start building our
calculator
with it's display.

383
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:45,999
So I wanna make a display.

384
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:47,917
So how do I do that?

385
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:49,834
Well that brings us to the right
side, the
right-hand side here,

386
00:19:49,837 --> 00:19:53,939
this whole right side, this is
called the
Utilities area.

387
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:56,675
You can see that's it's got a
bottom and a
top, right?

388
00:19:56,677 --> 00:20:01,979
We want to go into the bottom
and on the
third tab right here, which is
called

389
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:07,818
the Object Library, you'll see
that
there's tons and tons of objects
in here.

390
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,886
Okay, dozens of these things and

391
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:13,023
we're gonna get to a lot of
these by the
end of the quarter.

392
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:15,992
But these are the things you
build your
user interface out of.

393
00:20:15,994 --> 00:20:19,362
So kind of towards the top, not
all the
way at the top, but towards the
top,

394
00:20:19,364 --> 00:20:22,731
you'll start seeing things like
buttons
and text fields and things like
that.

395
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:26,401
Well this is what we need
obviously, to
build our display here,

396
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:28,536
is some sort of text field, and
there's a
couple of them here.

397
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:32,140
One, this one called Label is
static text,
you see?

398
00:20:32,142 --> 00:20:37,011
And this one Text Field is
editable text,
in other words you can touch on
this one.

399
00:20:37,013 --> 00:20:39,846
And the little keyboard would
slide up
from the bottom and you could
type in it.

400
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:42,882
So, the calculator, you can't
really touch
on the screen and

401
00:20:42,884 --> 00:20:45,018
start typing so we want this
static text.

402
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,721
So, I'm just going to pick this
up with
the mouse and drag it out.

403
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:50,990
Now, when I drag it out into my
UI,

404
00:20:50,991 --> 00:20:53,258
you're going to see a lot of
little blue
dash lines appearing.

405
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,227
You see these?

406
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:57,195
These are helping me put this in
the right
place.

407
00:20:57,197 --> 00:21:00,798
So, I can put it right in the
center, for
example, of my view.

408
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:04,335
I could put it up in a corner up
here,
which is what I'm gonna do.

409
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:05,669
Mm-kay.

410
00:21:05,671 --> 00:21:10,073
You always want your things that
you put
in your UI,

411
00:21:10,075 --> 00:21:14,643
as much as humanly possible, to
be on one
of these dashed blue lines.

412
00:21:14,645 --> 00:21:16,445
And you'll understand why in a
couple
weeks when we

413
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:18,097
starting talking about
auto-layout.

414
00:21:18,098 --> 00:21:19,748
I'm gonna do a little
auto-layout right
here just to kind of

415
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,351
give you a feel for it.

416
00:21:22,352 --> 00:21:24,953
But those blue, dashed blue
lines are
gonna be your best friend when
it comes to

417
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:28,322
building your user interface and
you'll
quickly see why that is.

418
00:21:28,324 --> 00:21:30,691
Once you drag something out like
this, you
can,

419
00:21:30,693 --> 00:21:34,061
these little things are rounded
that show
it's selected, right?

420
00:21:34,063 --> 00:21:38,465
They also are little resize
handles so you
can grab them and resize them
when you

421
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:42,235
resize it also re-puts those
dashed blue
lines out there, okay?

422
00:21:42,237 --> 00:21:43,969
So you definitely wanna, even
have,

423
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:47,106
when you're resizing, get those
things
lining up.

424
00:21:47,108 --> 00:21:50,976
You can also manipulate it
directly, just
double-click on it, like a
calculator

425
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:54,145
probably doesn't want to come
up, this is
gonna be initial state of this.

426
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:58,349
Doesn't want to come up saying
Label, it
probably wants 0 or

427
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:01,318
something like that in it's
display.

428
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,354
There's also things you wanna
set about
this though or

429
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:08,258
anything you drag in your UI
that you just
can't direct manipulate and

430
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,261
that's what the top half of this
Utilities
windows is, is for, okay?

431
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:13,829
So if you look at the top half
here,

432
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:17,065
there's a bunch of tabs across
the top
including something like this,

433
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:20,035
the Size Inspector for setting
the size of
this thing.

434
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:24,305
And this tab right here, really
important,
this is the Attributes
Inspector.

435
00:22:24,307 --> 00:22:27,908
And this is an object oriented
inspector,
depending on what you have
selected.

436
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,611
You'll have different user
interface here
in the top.

437
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:33,880
And this let's you edit
attributes about
what's selected.

438
00:22:33,882 --> 00:22:35,882
So, for example,

439
00:22:35,883 --> 00:22:37,883
a calculator, the zero doesn't
really want
to be on the left, right?

440
00:22:37,886 --> 00:22:40,653
Calculators, the zero, the
numbers are on
the right and

441
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:43,589
they kind of grow out from the
right.

442
00:22:43,591 --> 00:22:47,426
And so we can easily fix that
with this
alignment thing right here.

443
00:22:47,428 --> 00:22:50,595
So I'm gonna click this and you
see the
zero move over to the right.

444
00:22:50,597 --> 00:22:52,130
And, and maybe I want a bigger
font.

445
00:22:52,132 --> 00:22:53,231
You see the font right here.

446
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:55,666
I can click on this, pick
different fonts.

447
00:22:55,668 --> 00:22:59,470
I'm gonna just move it up to
like 32
point, it's a nice big font.

448
00:22:59,472 --> 00:23:00,937
You can notice it kinda cuts
off.

449
00:23:00,939 --> 00:23:02,572
I made it so big that it's too
small.

450
00:23:02,574 --> 00:23:06,976
So I can always just resize this
larger to
make that fit.

451
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:10,345
So this is how we build our user
interface.

452
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:14,949
It's very direct manipulation
and very
object oriented as you'll start
to

453
00:23:14,951 --> 00:23:17,451
see when we add different kinds
of
objects.

454
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:20,187
So, let's actually run this
application,
okay?

455
00:23:20,189 --> 00:23:22,956
We haven't done, built any
calculaterness
about it, but

456
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:25,992
we have this one field, let's
run it and
see what it looks like.

457
00:23:25,994 --> 00:23:27,226
So, how do you run things?

458
00:23:27,228 --> 00:23:29,562
Well, you see right here where
it says,
iPhone 6?

459
00:23:29,564 --> 00:23:33,331
This actually is a selector that
lets you
say where you want to

460
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,166
run your application.

461
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,636
So you can see you can run it on
an iOS
device if you have one
connected,

462
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:40,271
I don't have one connected
currently.

463
00:23:41,273 --> 00:23:43,056
But you can do that.

464
00:23:43,057 --> 00:23:44,840
And we'll talk in a Friday
section
probably in a week or

465
00:23:44,843 --> 00:23:48,478
two about how to get your
devices hooked
up.

466
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,948
But also there's these plethora
of
simulators here, iPhone 6,

467
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,552
6+, iPhone 5, iPhone 4s, iPad
Airs.

468
00:23:56,554 --> 00:23:58,920
And you can pick one of these to
run on
and

469
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:02,490
it'll actually simulate that
device right
here on your computer.

470
00:24:02,492 --> 00:24:05,827
So I'm gonna run on the iPhone
6.

471
00:24:05,829 --> 00:24:08,729
Okay,I'm just gonna hit Play,
see this
Play button right here?

472
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:11,498
That's how you simulate, so
Play.

473
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,933
Now it's launching the
simulator.

474
00:24:12,935 --> 00:24:14,601
It's a separate process.

475
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:16,169
And it's going to run our app in
there.

476
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:17,403
And there it is.

477
00:24:17,405 --> 00:24:18,737
Now you might say, whoop.

478
00:24:18,739 --> 00:24:19,905
Big white square.

479
00:24:19,907 --> 00:24:21,339
Oh that's not so good.

480
00:24:21,341 --> 00:24:23,825
And the reason this is so

481
00:24:23,826 --> 00:24:26,310
big is because the iPhone 6 has
a very
high resolution display on it.

482
00:24:26,312 --> 00:24:30,881
Okay, the retina display, and
it's way
higher resolution than my
computer, okay?

483
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:35,151
So I actually have to scroll
around, you
see there's the top of it.

484
00:24:35,153 --> 00:24:37,754
Scroll up and down to get to it
all.

485
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:42,558
Luckily if you go to Window,
this is not
in the simulator now, the iOS
simulator.

486
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,628
If you go to Window and Scale,
you can
scale it down to be smaller and

487
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,762
then it'll fit.

488
00:24:47,764 --> 00:24:49,497
Okay, so if you have a low
resolution
screen,

489
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:51,532
you're definitely gonna wanna
use Window >
Scale.

490
00:24:51,534 --> 00:24:54,368
Cmd+3 right there is another way
to do it.

491
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:57,654
Okay?

492
00:24:57,655 --> 00:25:00,939
So here's our UI, but it doesn't
look to
good, okay, because where's
this?

493
00:25:00,942 --> 00:25:05,011
We put this zero in there and it
just
never showed up, what did we do
wrong?

494
00:25:05,013 --> 00:25:08,781
Well we didn't really do
anything wrong
and that zero is actually there.

495
00:25:08,783 --> 00:25:11,750
It's just, here let me line up
these UI's,
this is not

496
00:25:11,752 --> 00:25:16,554
necessarily exactly the same
scale but its
appropriate, approximately the
same scale,

497
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:19,857
you can see that the zero is
actually off
screen, [NOISE] okay?

498
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:24,028
So its there but you just can't
see it
because its over here off the
screen.

499
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:28,465
Okay, and that's a problem, but
that's a
problem we can fix.

500
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:29,732
So let's go fix that problem.

501
00:25:31,302 --> 00:25:32,534
Why is that thing off-screen?

502
00:25:32,536 --> 00:25:35,837
Well, look at this UI right
here, okay?

503
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,838
What shape is it?

504
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,373
It's square.

505
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,908
Okay, no IOS device is square.

506
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,544
There's not a single square iOS
device in
the world.

507
00:25:43,546 --> 00:25:45,078
They're all, you know, tall and

508
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,581
thin, or, if you turn them
sideways, then
they're long and short.

509
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,650
Or even like an iPad.

510
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:52,718
You know the aspect ratio on an
iPad is
slightly different than an
iPhone so

511
00:25:52,721 --> 00:25:55,588
their all slightly different,
but none of
them are square.

512
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,657
So why do we design our UI in a
square?

513
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:03,762
Because the way you design iOS
interfaces,
you design them in this square
and

514
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:09,033
you give everything inside the
square
rules, called constraints,

515
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:12,236
about what happens to them when
they get
squished down.

516
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:15,505
Either squished down vertically,
squished
down horizontally,

517
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,508
depending on what kinda device
their
getting put on, okay?

518
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,912
So you put these rules in there,
so, what
does it look like to put these
rules in?

519
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:26,115
Well again, it's all direct
manipulation,
so

520
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:31,186
I'm going to give some rules to
this label
right here to make it so that it
knows

521
00:26:31,188 --> 00:26:36,957
what to do when this square gets
squished
down in any direction for any
device.

522
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:38,659
So, what do I want the rules to
be?

523
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:42,162
Well, I always want this thing
to use the
whole width.

524
00:26:42,164 --> 00:26:44,931
However much width I have, I
want it all.

525
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:50,102
So I'm gonna pin this right edge
to this
edge, okay?

526
00:26:50,104 --> 00:26:53,205
I'm gonna make it so all widths
are pinned
to each other.

527
00:26:53,207 --> 00:26:55,007
And I do that with the Ctrl key.

528
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:57,559
I've turned on sticky keys so

529
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,110
you can see down in the lower
left here,
it's showing the modifier keys
I'm using.

530
00:27:00,113 --> 00:27:02,213
So right now I'm holding down
Ctrl.

531
00:27:02,215 --> 00:27:08,485
And I'm gonna Ctrl+drag from the
right
edge of this to the container
it's in.

532
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:11,822
See how it's showing me what I'm
dragged
to.

533
00:27:11,824 --> 00:27:15,125
So when I drag to this
container, it puts
a menu up and says,

534
00:27:15,127 --> 00:27:20,830
oh, okay, you want some rule
between that
label's right edge and

535
00:27:20,832 --> 00:27:23,999
this thing's edge, what do you
want it to
be?

536
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:26,568
Well, I can do a lot of things
here.

537
00:27:26,569 --> 00:27:29,136
I could center this label
vertically in
this container.

538
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:31,590
Up, you know, vertical up and
down.

539
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:34,042
I definitely don't want that, I
want my
label at the top, so I don't
want that.

540
00:27:34,044 --> 00:27:35,776
I can make it the equal width,
so

541
00:27:35,778 --> 00:27:38,479
I can make this label the same
width as
the container.

542
00:27:38,481 --> 00:27:42,049
I don't want that either, cuz I
want this
little margin there, right?

543
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:45,785
But look at the top one,
trailing space to
container margin.

544
00:27:45,787 --> 00:27:51,157
This lets me pin the trailing
space after
my label to the margin of the
container.

545
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:55,194
So that's the one I want, so I'm
gonna
click on this and it does it.

546
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:59,664
Now, see all these yellow and
orange lines
that appeared when I did that?

547
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:03,401
That's because the systems like,
okay,
you've started telling me the
rules for

548
00:28:03,403 --> 00:28:06,504
this label, but your you haven't
told me
enough rules,

549
00:28:06,506 --> 00:28:08,005
I don't know what to do with
this thing.

550
00:28:08,007 --> 00:28:11,141
So now it's showing you all the
places
where it's like the system's not

551
00:28:11,143 --> 00:28:13,310
sure what to do now when this
thing gets
squished.

552
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:15,745
Before it was like, okay, well
you weren't
telling me anything so

553
00:28:15,747 --> 00:28:18,081
I'm not going to do anything,
but now your
starting to tell me.

554
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:19,648
So what do I do?

555
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:24,353
So we have to fully specify both
the what
happens horizontally and

556
00:28:24,355 --> 00:28:25,520
vertically to this thing.

557
00:28:25,522 --> 00:28:27,422
So we've only just started here.

558
00:28:27,424 --> 00:28:31,225
So let's pin this edge also cuz
we want
this edge to stay on this side.

559
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:34,528
So I'm gonna hold down Ctrl and
drag.

560
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:38,965
And now I'm gonna pin the
leading space to
the container margin.

561
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,100
Okay, boom that did that.

562
00:28:41,102 --> 00:28:44,670
Still have orange going on here,
that's
because I haven't specified
anything about

563
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:49,675
the vertical position of this
label so I'm
gonna pin the top to the top, so

564
00:28:49,677 --> 00:28:54,212
hold Ctrl again, drag up here,
this is now
top space.

565
00:28:54,214 --> 00:28:58,882
Notice that it realizes where I
am
dragging to and from, right?

566
00:28:58,884 --> 00:29:00,984
So they can give me options that
make
sense,

567
00:29:00,986 --> 00:29:03,186
like Top Space to Layout Guide
here.

568
00:29:03,188 --> 00:29:04,921
So I'm going to do that.

569
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:06,489
So now I'm starting to get blue
lines.

570
00:29:06,491 --> 00:29:07,489
You see these lines?

571
00:29:07,491 --> 00:29:08,657
I hope you can see that there.

572
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:11,493
They're solid blue, not orange
or red.

573
00:29:11,495 --> 00:29:16,230
Okay, that's because they're
okay, we are
okay horizontally here.

574
00:29:16,232 --> 00:29:18,332
But we still have a problem
vertically.

575
00:29:18,334 --> 00:29:21,335
Now I'm not sure exactly what
the problem
is vertically cuz I really don't

576
00:29:21,337 --> 00:29:23,536
want the bottom of this.

577
00:29:23,538 --> 00:29:27,773
I just want it to hang out
wherever it
wants to hang out based on the
size of my

578
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:29,041
font or whatever.

579
00:29:29,043 --> 00:29:31,610
So I don't, I don't really wanna
specify
anything here so

580
00:29:31,612 --> 00:29:34,212
why is this orange and how do I
get rid of
this?

581
00:29:34,214 --> 00:29:37,648
Well any time you have orange
and when
you're doing this layout stuff
and

582
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,949
you don't know what to do.

583
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:41,885
You wanna go down to this button
right
here, okay?

584
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:44,905
This is the document outline.

585
00:29:44,906 --> 00:29:47,924
And when you click this, a
little thing
will slide out, a little shelf
here.

586
00:29:47,926 --> 00:29:53,095
And this is an outline view of
everything
that's in your UI.

587
00:29:53,097 --> 00:29:54,897
Okay?
And they're linked, so

588
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:58,000
if I click the background,
nothing is
selected.

589
00:29:58,002 --> 00:30:00,769
Then the background, the view is
what's
selected here.

590
00:30:00,771 --> 00:30:04,605
But if I click this L0, which
means a
label with zero in it,

591
00:30:04,607 --> 00:30:06,240
look it's selected my.

592
00:30:06,242 --> 00:30:10,143
Zero label, and vice versa if I
click on
this here, it selects it over
here.

593
00:30:10,145 --> 00:30:14,380
So this is this same thing in an
outline
mode.

594
00:30:14,382 --> 00:30:16,349
This is really nice to have.

595
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,317
Sometimes you have views that
are
overlapping and they're kind of
in

596
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,421
each other's way, you can always
go here
to select the one you want,
okay?

597
00:30:22,423 --> 00:30:27,525
And you can Ctrl+drag to these
over here
too it's just as much
Ctrl+draggable as

598
00:30:27,527 --> 00:30:30,294
some of these other things.

599
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:32,513
But what we're, and we'll look,

600
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,731
we'll talk about top layout
guide, bottom
layout guide a little later.
稍后我们将讨论一下顶部和底部的布局指南。

601
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:38,369
But what I really want you to
focus on is
this little yellow circle up
here.
但是我想让你注意这个黄色的小圆圈

602
00:30:38,371 --> 00:30:39,870
'Kay?
Any time you got yellow and
好的，任何时候，你都会在使用auto-Layout中看到黄色和橙色的警告

603
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,172
orange problems with this
auto-layout
business,

604
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:45,108
you're gonna get this little
yellow circle
appearing in your document
outline.
你可以在你的左侧文档中看到这个小黄圈出现。

605
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:50,479
And if you click it, it'll slide
in a list
of all the problems.
如果你点击它，它会展开一个列表，呈现所有的问题

606
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:54,349
And so here I highlight over
this and this
is where all the orange and
yellow is.
如果选中它，出现高亮的部分就是警告所出现的地方

607
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:59,487
It's saying the label with the 0
in it
expected the height to be 39 but
它提示这个label的高度应该是39，但

608
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:00,955
the actual height is 57.
真实的情况却是57。

609
00:31:00,957 --> 00:31:03,824
Well that's because after I set
this font,
这是因为我在设置了这个字体后，

610
00:31:03,826 --> 00:31:06,460
I just dragged this down a
little bit to
make space.
我向下的拖动了一部分，让它多出来一些区域。

611
00:31:06,462 --> 00:31:09,262
All right, I, I wasn't very, I,
I didn't
know it was supposed to be 39.
好吧，我不是很，我不是很清楚它支持的高度是39。

612
00:31:09,264 --> 00:31:11,330
I just dragged down.
我只是稍稍向下拖动了而已。

613
00:31:11,332 --> 00:31:14,283
And so it's saying that's wrong.
这样，Xcode给了我一个警告。

614
00:31:14,284 --> 00:31:17,235
Now, I could just try drag it
back up and
meet this dashed line.
现在,我可以试着将其拖动，和这个虚线重叠。

615
00:31:17,238 --> 00:31:19,738
This dashed line, by the way,
强调下这条虚线，

616
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:22,239
is where it's kind of saying,
this is
really where this thing wants to
be.
它表明了这个标签真实的大小。

617
00:31:22,242 --> 00:31:24,642
But the solid lines are where it
actually
is.
但是实线是我们希望的样子。

618
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:29,313
So I could kinda drag it up to
there, but
I, I could be off by a pixel or
所以我可能拖动到那里，但是我也许会相差1个像素或

619
00:31:29,315 --> 00:31:31,749
something else.
出现一些其他的区别。

620
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,184
A much more reliable way is to
click this
little yellow triangle, 'kay?
现在有一个可靠的方法，点击这个黄色小三角，好了吗？

621
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:36,186
So I'm gonna click this yellow
triangle.
我将要点击这个。

622
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:37,854
It's gonna bring up this pop-up
window.
它会弹出一个窗口。

623
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:42,091
And there's three ways to fix
the
problems, okay?
这里给出了三个修改问题的方法，好了吗同学？

624
00:31:42,093 --> 00:31:45,327
One way, Update Constraints,
this middle
way right here.
其中一个，更新约束，在第二个。

625
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:49,098
That's a way that says, hey, I
want this
thing to be,
这个方法是，我想要这样做，

626
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,199
this label to be right where it
is.
这个label这样才是正确的。

627
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,967
So just make some constraints.
所以只要做一些约束。

628
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:53,634
Make it up.
弥补上这个缺点。

629
00:31:53,636 --> 00:31:56,237
Make it happen!
让它自己完成。

630
00:31:56,238 --> 00:31:58,839
And it'll put some wacky
constraints in
there like 52 high, which is a
bad
它会把一些古怪的约束添加到这个52高度，这是一个坏的

631
00:31:58,841 --> 00:32:02,309
constraint for it to be, 52
high, cuz this
label wants to be its natural
height.
约束，因为52的高度不是这个标签真正的高度。

632
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:04,378
It doesn't want to be 52 high.
它的高度不是52。

633
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,346
So this'll kinda force
constraint.
所以这里就可以用强制性的约束。

634
00:32:06,348 --> 00:32:08,614
You'll almost never want this
one, 'kay.
当然你也许不希望这样。

635
00:32:08,616 --> 00:32:11,250
Rarely do you wanna force the
constraints.
你很少想强制性的去约束。

636
00:32:11,252 --> 00:32:14,520
Reset to Suggested Constraints
would
probably just work here.
这个就是设置label为建议性的约束。

637
00:32:14,522 --> 00:32:16,788
I'm not gonna choose this one,
but it
would probably work.
我不会选择这个，即使它可能是正确的。

638
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:21,125
This one is going to make the
constraints
match the blue lines.
这个是将约束调整为蓝色的线条。

639
00:32:21,127 --> 00:32:24,762
Those dashed blue lines that I
told you
always wanna meet.
那些蓝线，我告诉你是必须达到的。

640
00:32:24,764 --> 00:32:28,899
Those are what's gonna help the
system
pick suggested constraints.
那些是系统帮助选择出来的约束。

641
00:32:28,901 --> 00:32:32,769
So since we dragged that label
out to the
blue lines perfectly,
因为我们拖动的label是蓝色的，

642
00:32:32,771 --> 00:32:36,639
I'll bet if I said Reset to
Suggested
Constraints, it might just work.
我敢打赌，我点击了重置约束，它也是能够工作的。

643
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:38,941
Okay.
But I'm actually gonna show you
this
好的。我想告诉你这个

644
00:32:38,943 --> 00:32:43,646
last option up on top, which is
Update
Frame and what this says is,
take into
选项，它是能够更新框架和

645
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:49,918
consideration all the rules and
move this
label to where the rules say it
should be.
所有的约束规则，让label的按照规则进行移动。

646
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,187
'Kay.
And I like this option a lot
because it
好的，我喜欢这个选项

647
00:32:52,189 --> 00:32:55,523
lets you kind of preview, do I
have my
little rules right, okay?
它让你能够预览，我有一个正确的结果，对吗？

648
00:32:55,525 --> 00:32:59,860
So let's try that, let's see if
the, we'll
tell the, move this label, go
ahead and
我们尝试一下，看下移动后的标签是

649
00:32:59,862 --> 00:33:03,564
move yourself and size yourself
to obey
these three rules we you put in,
and
遵守你自己的设定的那三个约束，

650
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:06,066
we'll fix the misplacement, so
let's try
it.
我们点击这个按钮，让我们尝试下。

651
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:10,269
And sure enough it did it, it
says there
are no auto layout issues.
果然做到了，没有任何问题。

652
00:33:10,271 --> 00:33:14,940
If I go back to my document
outline, this
little yellow circle is gone.
如果你回到自己的目录列表，这个黄色的小圆圈已经消失了。

653
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:18,810
If I look in my view, everything
is
blue-lined, no yellow or red.
看看自己的视图，全部都是蓝线，没有红色或黄色的。

654
00:33:20,146 --> 00:33:22,630
Okay?
So that's your
好了吗？这就说明你的

655
00:33:22,631 --> 00:33:25,115
crash course on auto layout, and
we're
gonna talk a lot more about auto
layout,
自动布局已经完成，我们接下来讨论下更多的自动布局

656
00:33:25,118 --> 00:33:28,719
in fact, even on Wednesday I'm
gonna do
another auto layout with all the
buttons.
在周三的时候我们将要尝试给所有的按钮进行自动布局。

657
00:33:28,721 --> 00:33:30,671
Right?
The keypad buttons, and
真的？所有的键盘按钮

658
00:33:30,672 --> 00:33:32,622
all that, which is a lot more
things being
laid out.
这听起来真的蛮多的。

659
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:34,224
But let's see if this fixes our
problem.
接着让我们看下如何修改这些。

660
00:33:34,226 --> 00:33:37,527
Let's go ahead and run our
application
again.
我们再次运行一下应用。

661
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:39,795
So I'm just hitting that play
button.
点击这个运行按钮。

662
00:33:39,797 --> 00:33:41,563
Here it, oh, we got our zero
this time.
此刻，我们现在可以看到这个0了。

663
00:33:41,565 --> 00:33:45,334
You see how it pinned this zero
to that
edge?
你注意到这个零的边缘了吗?

664
00:33:45,336 --> 00:33:48,036
And not only that, if we rotate
this
phoned,
不仅可以这样，如果我们旋转模拟器，

665
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:52,273
which you can do in the
Simulators menu,
Hardware > Rotate.
你可以在模拟器的菜单中点击Hardware>Rotate。

666
00:33:53,976 --> 00:33:58,378
Look the 0, this got wider and
the 0 kept
pin, pinning itself over to
that.
看看这个0，它本身还保持着这个距离。

667
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,981
And it also stayed on the top
even though
this got, whole thing got
shorter.
它也保持着距离顶部的距离，底部距离变短了。

668
00:34:01,983 --> 00:34:04,884
Okay.
And if I rotate back, the 0
stays there.
接下来，如果我旋转回来，0还是保持原样。

669
00:34:04,886 --> 00:34:07,420
Question.
So what did it do at the bottom
there?
学生提问：是什么让它底部产生了变化。

670
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:10,422
Like what did the actual update
frame end
up doing?
就像你已经更新过那里的约束了一样。

671
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,758
What did the update frame in the
document
outline do?
在目录中的更新框架做了什么呢？

672
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,693
Yes.
It moved this bottom edge up.
是的，它改变了底部的边缘距离。

673
00:34:14,695 --> 00:34:17,462
You see this is only 39 pixels
high now.
你看现在是39的像素高度。

674
00:34:17,464 --> 00:34:18,396
It was 52.
之前它是52.

675
00:34:18,397 --> 00:34:19,329
So, yeah, it just moved it up.
这样，它发生了改变，向上移动了。

676
00:34:19,332 --> 00:34:21,665
It, it, and if other things had
been
yellow,
如果其他事情提示黄色，

677
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:23,133
it could have moved the whole
thing.
它可能移动整体了。

678
00:34:23,135 --> 00:34:24,718
Right?
It would move that
好的，它将移动这

679
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,302
whole rectangle wherever the
rule said but
整个矩形达到约束的那样，但是

680
00:34:26,304 --> 00:34:29,539
in this case, you can fi that
one problem
by moving it up.
这种情况，你能够向上拖动来修改这个问题。

681
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:30,139
Good question.
好问题。

682
00:34:31,342 --> 00:34:32,040
Okay?
可以了嘛？

683
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:33,541
So that's good.
不错。

684
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:34,976
All right.
好的。

685
00:34:34,977 --> 00:34:36,410
So that's it for auto layout.
让我们回到自动布局上。

686
00:34:36,413 --> 00:34:38,346
Auto layout part one.
自动布局的第一部分。

687
00:34:38,348 --> 00:34:43,016
So now let's talk a little bit
about
connecting our user interface
that we're
所以现在让我们来谈谈我们的界面,我们

688
00:34:43,018 --> 00:34:45,385
building right here, up to the
code,
建立在这里，通过代码

689
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:48,254
cuz we want that code to be able
to talk
to the user interface.
因为我们想让代码能够告诉用户界面。

690
00:34:48,256 --> 00:34:51,157
Otherwise how are we gonna have
the number
buttons,
否则我们如何拥有数字按钮，

691
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,425
make numbers appear up here in
the
display?
使数字展现在这里

692
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:56,795
Or the times button, give the
results of
the calculation up here.
或一些按钮，告诉计算结果在这里。

693
00:34:56,797 --> 00:34:58,363
We gotta be able to talk to
this.
我们必须能够与之交互。

694
00:34:58,365 --> 00:35:01,633
So how do we do that?
但是如何做到呢？

695
00:35:01,634 --> 00:35:04,902
And the answer, first step is,
we need to
get both this co, this Swift
Code,
正确答案，第一步需要我们在controller中编写Swift代码，

696
00:35:04,904 --> 00:35:10,440
the controller, and this view on
screen at
the same time, 'kay?
和这个视图相互对应。

697
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,742
Cuz we're gonna connect them so
we need
them on screen at the same time,
因为我们会连接他们,所以我们需要在屏幕上在同一时间

698
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:17,180
and there's a lot of ways to do
that, but
I'll do the simplest way right
here,
还有很多方面,在这里我要用最简单的方法,

699
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:20,616
which is this little button
called the
assistant editor, all right?
这个小按钮叫助理编辑，好了吗？

700
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,184
So I'm gonna click that and
look!
我要点击这个。

701
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:25,120
It put them both on screen at
the same
time, exactly what I wanted.
这时你能看到屏幕分成了两部分，这正是我想要的。

702
00:35:25,122 --> 00:35:27,355
Now it's all a little crowded
here.
现在它这里是比较拥挤的。

703
00:35:27,357 --> 00:35:31,892
Even if I expand my view a
little bit,
it's like it's all smashed in
here.
即使我放大整个界面，它看起来还是这么小。

704
00:35:31,894 --> 00:35:35,696
Luckily the navigator and the
utilities
can also be hidden,
幸运的是导航栏这些都是可以隐藏起来的，

705
00:35:35,698 --> 00:35:37,931
see these buttons up here, these
three
buttons?
看到这些按钮了嘛，这有三个按钮。

706
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:40,734
This left one, if you click it
hides the
navigator and
左侧这个，如果你点击它则会隐藏左侧导航，

707
00:35:40,736 --> 00:35:45,504
this right one if you click it
hides
utilities, 'kay?
点击右侧这个，则会右侧右边的工具栏。

708
00:35:45,506 --> 00:35:50,308
So now we have both my UI and
over here we
can still double click to zoom
out, but
现在我们可以看到他们都在视线中，我们可以双击缩放它，但

709
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:54,646
the thing is, anytime we're
actually
connecting our UI to our code or
事情是这样的,在我们实际连接UI代码或

710
00:35:54,648 --> 00:35:59,183
trying to edit anything in here,
you need
to be zoomed to normal, 'kay?
尝试去编辑的时候，你需要把缩放比例调到正常。

711
00:35:59,185 --> 00:36:02,353
For example if I tried to select
if I'm
zoomed out and
例如这个，如果我选择这个比例

712
00:36:02,355 --> 00:36:04,955
I try to select this 0 I just
can't.
我就不能选中这个0了。

713
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:08,891
This is really kind of a bird's
eye view
just for seeing what your UI
looks like.
这个其实只是一个预览图，让你看看大体样子，而不能编辑。

714
00:36:08,893 --> 00:36:10,726
If you wanna actually work on
it,
你只有这样才能够继续工作，

715
00:36:10,727 --> 00:36:12,560
you double-click to zoom in on
this scene
that you're interested in.
你双击选择这个窗口即可。

716
00:36:14,064 --> 00:36:15,630
Okay, so here's our Swift code.
好了，现在我们开始编写Swift代码。

717
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:17,598
I'm actually gonna delete these.
我将要删除这些。

718
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,635
We don't need them for the
calculator.
在我们的应用中是不需要这些的。

719
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,671
We will need these things for
future
application but we don't need it
for
我们需要一些计算功能，但这些不需要。
720
00:36:23,673 --> 00:36:24,338
the calculator.

720
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,974
And this is your first look at
Swift,
'kay.
接着，你将要开始第一个Swift的编写。

721
00:36:27,976 --> 00:36:31,711
So Swift, as I said, very
concise
language, but it's basically an
object
我说过，Swift是非常简洁的语言，但它还是一个

722
00:36:31,713 --> 00:36:36,048
oriented language, it's gonna
look a lot
like C, some things look a lot
like Java.
面向对象语言，它看起来像C，有人说它有点像java。

723
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:40,385
It's kind of the, you know, best
of, of a
lot of different worlds at once.
你知道，最好的，很多不同的地方。

724
00:36:40,387 --> 00:36:44,823
Now this import is just
importing the UI
portion of iOS.
这只是iOS导入UI的一部分。

725
00:36:44,825 --> 00:36:47,658
You usually won't have to
specify import
yourself unless you start
你通常不需要指定导入，除非你开始

726
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:52,496
using frameworks that are not,
you know,
the base frameworks and we'll
get to that
不使用框架，你知道基础框架和我们将要

727
00:36:52,498 --> 00:36:56,233
probably weeks into the quarter
where you
fi, finally have to do an import
yourself.
使用的一些会需要自己进行导入。

728
00:36:56,235 --> 00:36:58,601
So this how it automatically got
put here
for us.
这里我们看到它自动的为我们添加了。

729
00:36:58,603 --> 00:37:02,838
And so this is really your first
line of
Swift code, 'kay?
在这里要开始你的第一行Swift的代码。

730
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,975
Appropriately, it's a definition
of a
class.
这里是定义了一个类。

731
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:10,479
Cuz Swift is fundamentally
object-oriented
and here we're defining a class.
因为Swift从根本上来讲是面向对象的，这里是定义的一个类。

732
00:37:10,481 --> 00:37:13,448
So what does the syntax look
like to
define a class?
这里的语法看起来像定义一个类吗？

733
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:15,416
You got the keyword class.
你看到类这个关键字。

734
00:37:15,418 --> 00:37:16,817
You got the name of the class.
这里是这个类的名称。

735
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:20,654
Now this name ViewController,
pretty bad
name, [LAUGH].
现在这个名字看起来很糟糕。

736
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:23,523
Okay, very generic, really they
should
probably be something like
好吧,真的很一般,他们应该是类似

737
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:26,593
CalculatorViewController,
something
specific to
CalculatorViewController这样的命名

738
00:37:26,595 --> 00:37:33,599
this particular scene that we're
working
on right here, that it's
controlling.
这样看起来就让人清楚他是控制哪里的了。

739
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:35,668
This is the default name it
gives you.
这是个默认的名字。

740
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,337
I don't want to spend the
valuable demo
time showing how to
我不想花费宝贵的时间去演示如何

741
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,656
rename this cuz unfortunately,
重命名这个，因为

742
00:37:40,657 --> 00:37:42,974
I can't just type a new name
here because
I gotta keep the UI in sync with
it.
我不能在这里输入一个新名字,因为我要保持UI同步。

743
00:37:42,976 --> 00:37:45,276
So I would have to do something
in the UI
as well.
所以我必须做一些事情在UI中。

744
00:37:45,278 --> 00:37:48,079
But, for now, for your first
assignment or
two we're, we'll just
但是现在，你的第一个任务或两个，我们只会

745
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:51,548
call this ViewController, but
down the
road you're gonna wanna pick
better names.
叫他ViewController，但你最好给他更换一个好的名字。

746
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,251
And of course you're gonna be
building
multiple of
当然你可以创建一个

747
00:37:54,253 --> 00:37:57,554
these scenes in this class in
the same app
in the future, so
新的类在其中，

748
00:37:57,556 --> 00:38:01,024
of course, they'll all have
different
controller names.
他们都有一个不同的名称。

749
00:38:01,026 --> 00:38:07,796
Okay, this :UIViewController,
that's
inheritance, that's its
superclass, okay?
这个UIViewController是告诉我们它的父类是谁。

750
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:12,334
Swift is single inheritance, so
you can
only inherit from one class.
Swift是一个单继承，你只能让他继承一个类。

751
00:38:12,336 --> 00:38:16,137
It's perfectly fine in Swift not
to
inherit from a class if you
don't want to,
如果你不想这样，它是能够完整的继承一个类，

752
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:18,139
all right?

753
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,140
But here we have to inherit from
UIViewController cuz we
在这里我们有UIViewController，因为我们

754
00:38:20,142 --> 00:38:23,176
want all this magic that allows
us to
control the UI,
想通过它来控制UI，

755
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:27,880
like that whole auto layout
business, and
there's a ton of mechanism in
here for
像自动布局功能，这其中有许多的原理

756
00:38:27,882 --> 00:38:31,083
the, the allowing the controller
to
control this UI.
允许控制器来控制这个UI

757
00:38:31,085 --> 00:38:35,487
So obviously we do that so all
ViewControllers, all controllers
of these
很明显，所有viewcontroller,所有控制器

758
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:40,425
little scenes always inherit
from either
from UIViewController directly
or they
这些小场景总是继承UIViewController或者它们

759
00:38:40,427 --> 00:38:45,296
inherit from a class that
inherits from
UIViewController or up their
chain so.
继承的类的UIViewController或它们的链。

760
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:51,134
And then inside this curly brace
is simply
all the instance variables and
然后在这个花括号中所有实例变量和

761
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:54,070
methods in this class, 'kay?
方法在这个类中。

762
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:58,207
So very simple syntax to define
a class.
定义类的语法是非常简练的。

763
00:38:58,209 --> 00:39:02,144
So let's dive right into making
some
instance variables and methods
so
所以让我们忙于做一些实例变量和方法

764
00:39:02,146 --> 00:39:03,912
you can see what those look
like.
你可以调整下位置。

765
00:39:03,914 --> 00:39:09,216
And I thought we, this was
segued to
because we're going to
我想我们，应该连接这个，因为我们想要这个

766
00:39:09,218 --> 00:39:12,953
say we wanted to connect this UI
to this
code.
UI连接到代码中。

767
00:39:12,955 --> 00:39:15,072
So let's do that.
我们现在就这样做。

768
00:39:15,073 --> 00:39:17,190
Let's connect this label right
here into
this code, and
我们连接这个label到代码中去，

769
00:39:17,192 --> 00:39:20,560
then we're gonna do that by
making an
instance variable.
然后我们会通过一个实例变量。

770
00:39:20,562 --> 00:39:23,062
In Swift we call them
properties.
在Swift中我们叫它属性。

771
00:39:23,064 --> 00:39:25,330
'Kay so if you hear me say
property,
如果你听到我说属性，

772
00:39:25,332 --> 00:39:27,165
I'm basically talking about an
instance
variable.
那我其实就是在说实例变量。

773
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:29,467
Right?
A variable that is part of the
class.
清楚吗？一个变量是类的一部分。

774
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:31,869
Every instance of the class gets
its own
copy of it.
类的每个实例都有自己的拷贝。

775
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:34,171
Hopefully you all know what an
instance
variable is.
希望你都知道什么是一个实例变量。

776
00:39:34,173 --> 00:39:35,739
If you don't, again, this class,
如果你不清楚，再说一次，这是类，

777
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:38,408
heavy object-oriented, you
should
definitely know that.
面向对象的，你应该清楚。

778
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,678
So I'm gonna make a property
here, an
instance variable,
我将要声明一个属性在这里，也可以说是一个实例变量。

779
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,848
that points to this label, so
that I can
update the label's text, right?
使用指针指向这个lable，这样就我就能够更新这个label的内容了。

780
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:50,486
I need to be able to talk to
this label,
and the way you do that in iO
eh,
我需要告诉这个label，

781
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:55,824
in Xcode is you hold down Ctrl,
just like
we did when we were making
在Xcode中，你按住Ctrl，像刚才那样

782
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:59,627
a connection to the edge, so I'm
holding
down Ctrl and clicking on the
label, but
连接边缘，我保持住点击Ctrl和左键在这个label上，但是

783
00:39:59,629 --> 00:40:02,596
instead of going to the edge,
I'm gonna go
into the code, 'kay?
不是要添加约束，我是想让它到代码中去，

784
00:40:02,598 --> 00:40:06,166
Now this is kinda wacky.
这是有点古怪。

785
00:40:06,168 --> 00:40:07,901
I know a lot of you are like
what?
我知道很多你喜欢什么？

786
00:40:07,903 --> 00:40:08,501
Into the code?
在代码中？

787
00:40:08,503 --> 00:40:11,004
Yeah?

788
00:40:11,005 --> 00:40:13,506
So we're going right into the
code here
and let go and it's gonna say
oh,
现在我们到右边代码中，松开鼠标。

789
00:40:13,508 --> 00:40:16,308
you wanna make a connection
between your
UI and your controller.
你能连接UI和控制器了。

790
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,844
No problem, what kinda
connection you
wanna make?
没问题了，接下来需要做什么？

791
00:40:18,846 --> 00:40:20,846
And we wanna make what's called
an outlet
connection.
我们需要设置outlet连接。

792
00:40:20,848 --> 00:40:22,681
An outlet means an instance
variable or
一个outlet在实例变量或

793
00:40:22,683 --> 00:40:25,717
property that points to this
thing in the
UI.
属性，这个指针指向UI。

794
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:30,021
And all it needs to know to do
that is,
what do you wanna call this
property?
接着你需要给这个属性一个名称。

795
00:40:30,023 --> 00:40:34,925
And this is the display of my
calculator
so I'm gonna call this display
and it
它将出现在我的计算器，所以我将命名为了display，

796
00:40:34,927 --> 00:40:38,962
already knows the type of the
thing is UI
label of course cuz we dragged
from here.
这是说它是什么类型的，因为我们是从这里拖出来的。

797
00:40:38,964 --> 00:40:41,431
Don't worry about this weak,
I'll talk
about that in a moment.
不要担心这个弱连接，在后面我们会讲到。

798
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:45,067
And then we just hit Connect,
and it
creates an instance variable or
然后我们点击这个按钮,它会创建一个实例变量或

799
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:47,202
property, right here in our
controller.
称之为属性，完成后就出现在这里了。

800
00:40:47,204 --> 00:40:51,339
So this is a great opportunity
to look at
the syntax in Swift for
在Swift中这个语法就是

801
00:40:51,341 --> 00:40:54,109
creating a property.
创建一个属性。

802
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,878
And there's a couple of things
on here
that are not normally part of
it.
这里有几件事情通常都不是它的一部分。

803
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,516
This is you, the main syntax for
creating
a property.
这是你的主要语法创建一个属性。

804
00:41:02,518 --> 00:41:04,418
Let's quickly look at this thing
to get it
out of the way.
我们快速的了解下这个get方法。

805
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,454
This is not really part of the
Swift
language proper.
这不是Swift真正语言的一部分。

806
00:41:07,456 --> 00:41:09,555
This is something Xcode puts in
here so
这是Xcode将在这里

807
00:41:09,557 --> 00:41:14,526
that this little circle, do you
see the
little circle in this gutter,
appears?
这个小圆圈，你可以看到这个小圆圈出现在这里。

808
00:41:14,528 --> 00:41:18,463
This little circle when I mouse
over it,
look what Xcode does.
当我把鼠标移动到上面时候，看看Xcode的变化。

809
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:21,933
It shows me what this line of
code is
connected to.
它展示了我选中的代码所连接的UI。

810
00:41:21,935 --> 00:41:23,852
'Kay?
So that's really cool, and
这看起来非常酷，

811
00:41:23,853 --> 00:41:25,770
you're gonna see that's really
valuable
later in this demo,
在这个demo中这是非常有用的，

812
00:41:25,772 --> 00:41:27,838
is being able to find out what
things are
connected to.
它能找到我们连接的是什么控件。

813
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,773
So that's all this thing means
here.
这个就是它所展示的意义。

814
00:41:29,775 --> 00:41:33,777
You, you, you don't type this in
yourself,
that when you Ctrl+drag, it puts
it there.
当你Ctrl+点击拖动时候你不清楚是什么类型，它所说的。

815
00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:38,748
This weak, all you, you, if you
come from
other languages,
这个weak，如果你从其他语言过来到。

816
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:44,653
you're used to things like
garbage
collection to clean up the heap.
你会使用过类似的垃圾回收机制。

817
00:41:44,655 --> 00:41:46,288
Or maybe you even have to alloc
and
或者你也许习惯自己分配和

818
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:50,258
free things yourself manually in
some
languages.
释放管理在一些语言中。

819
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,792
None of that in Swift.
在Swift中是没有的。

820
00:41:51,794 --> 00:41:54,828
In Swift, the, all objects live
in the
heap, 'kay.
在Swift中，所有的对象都在堆中。

821
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:58,398
All class, the instances of
classes live
in the heap.
所有类，类的实例都存在类的堆中。

822
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,335
And the memory for them is
managed for
you, 'kay?
替你进行了内存管理。

823
00:42:02,337 --> 00:42:05,371
You allocate them as much as you
want, as
soon as there's no pointers to
them,
你分配他们尽可能多的你想要的，只要没有了指针指向它们，

824
00:42:05,373 --> 00:42:08,274
they get cleaned up, and it's
not garbage
collection, 'kay?
它们会自动清理，不需要垃圾回收。

825
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,493
It's reference counting.
这就是引用计数。

826
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:12,711
It's actually counting
references to them
but it's all automatic.
它实际上是计算引用他们的次数，但这都是自动的。

827
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:16,548
The only thing you ever have to
be maybe
interested in is this weak
business which
你曾经也许唯一感兴趣的是这个weak的功能，

828
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,851
is less than a hundredth of a
percent of
the time.
在小于百分之一的时间。

829
00:42:19,853 --> 00:42:23,788
And for the first four weeks of
this
class, forget about weak.
前四周的课程中，忘掉有关weak的吧。

830
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:27,591
It'll automatically happen when
you do
this Ctrl+drag, but just ignore
it.
当你使用Ctrl+点击拖动时候，它会自动完成，所以先忽略这个吧。

831
00:42:27,593 --> 00:42:29,560
But the main thing to know is
that all
that memory
但是最主要的事情是知道有关内存管理

832
00:42:29,562 --> 00:42:31,128
management is happening for you.
会发生在你身上的。

833
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:34,330
Also this, instance variable
right here,
同时，实例变量在这里，

834
00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:38,267
which is a pointer to this
object, notice
there's no ampersands or
通过一个指针指向对象，注意到没有与符号或

835
00:42:38,269 --> 00:42:42,271
stars or any other kind of
syntax that
says this is a pointer.
星或者其他任何语法说这是一个指针。

836
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:44,406
'Kay?

837
00:42:44,407 --> 00:42:46,540
If you have a instance, variable
or
property or
如果你有一个实例变量或属性或

838
00:42:46,543 --> 00:42:48,910
local variable that is an
object, okay,
局部变量都是一个对象。

839
00:42:48,912 --> 00:42:52,980
it's always a pointer to it cuz
objects
only live in the heap, 'kay?
它总是一个指针，因为对象只在堆中存在着。

840
00:42:52,982 --> 00:42:54,648
So you don't need all that extra
stars and
所以不需要多余的*和&，

841
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,184
ampersand, any of that business
from other
languages, okay?
不要从其他语言中借鉴。

842
00:42:58,286 --> 00:43:01,587
This exclamation point, by the
way, I'm
gonna talk about in a few
minutes,
这个感叹号，顺便说一下，我要谈几分钟

843
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:04,023
has nothing to do with this
being an
object, okay?
这是和对象不相关的。

844
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:05,858
This is, this totally separate
thing.
这完全不相干的事情。

845
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,092
We'll get to it.
我们会得到它。

846
00:43:07,094 --> 00:43:08,043
All right.

847
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:08,993
So let's look at this.
让我们看看这个。

848
00:43:08,995 --> 00:43:15,166
This is the syntax for defining
a
property, 'kay?
这个语法是定义了一个属性，对吗？

849
00:43:15,168 --> 00:43:16,066
An instance variable.
一个实例变量。

850
00:43:16,068 --> 00:43:18,519
And it's very simple.
并且它是如此的简单。

851
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,971
You got var, short for variable
cuz that's
what this is, a variable.
你看到var，它是变量的缩写。

852
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,473
The name, this is the name of
it, display.
这是变量的名称，display

853
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,475
Okay?
That's just the name of this
property.
这个属性的名字是这个。

854
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,909
And then :UILabel!
紧接着就是UILabel。

855
00:43:26,911 --> 00:43:28,510
Is the type, 'kay?
这个是它的类型。

856
00:43:28,512 --> 00:43:33,815
That's the type of this instance
variable.
这个类似是这个实例变量的。

857
00:43:33,817 --> 00:43:38,452
So again, I'll talk about the
exclamation
point later, but
我稍后会讲到那个感叹号，但

858
00:43:38,454 --> 00:43:42,389
obviously this thing is pointing
to this
label so that we can talk to it.
很明显，这是指向label的，我们能这样说。

859
00:43:42,391 --> 00:43:43,590
And we'll be doing that in a
moment.
我们能够这样去做。

860
00:43:43,592 --> 00:43:44,424
'Kay?

861
00:43:44,426 --> 00:43:46,325
Questions?
有什么疑问吗？

862
00:43:46,327 --> 00:43:49,962
All right, let's talk about
another kind
of connection we may,
好的，让我们来谈谈另一种连接，

863
00:43:49,964 --> 00:43:52,364
we can make, let's start putting
some
buttons in our calculator.
我们可以，让我们开始放一些计算器的按钮吧。

864
00:43:52,366 --> 00:43:55,100
So I'm gonna go back to the
Utilities
window, 'kay?
我将要打开这个工具窗口。

865
00:43:55,102 --> 00:43:56,734
By pressing this button over
here,
按下这个按钮，

866
00:43:56,736 --> 00:44:00,705
go down to the bottom, go to the
third tab
over here, the object library.
找到下方的第三个选项的对象目录。

867
00:44:00,707 --> 00:44:04,775
And instead of a label, this
time I'm
gonna drag out a button.
这次拖的不是label，我将要拖动出来一个按钮。

868
00:44:04,777 --> 00:44:07,143
Okay?
I'm gonna put this button here
now.
现在我要把这个按钮放到这里。

869
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:11,414
Just to be different, I'm not
gonna
initially line it up with a blue
line.
有些不同，我没有初始化蓝色的线。

870
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:14,283
I'm just gonna put it kinda in
space out
here and
我只是想把它放在这个空间中，

871
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:17,119
I'll line it up with the blue
line later,
'kay?
将它放在蓝线的下面。

872
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,487
But I don't wanna forget to do
that
though, I always wanna do that.
但我不会忘记做，我总是期望这样。

873
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:22,724
What I'm gonna do later is to
show you it
can be done.
以后我要做的就是告诉你这是可以做到的。

874
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:26,127
So, this is gonna be, let's say
this is
gonna be one of our number
buttons.
接着，我们可以说这就是一个数字按钮。

875
00:44:26,129 --> 00:44:30,197
Like the upper left corner of
our keypad
is a 7.
就像键盘左上角的数字7。

876
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:31,598
Okay?

877
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:32,998
Again, I have the same thing
over here.
我还需要其他的一些。

878
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:35,368
Okay?
With the attributes inspector I
can
通过属性设置，我能够

879
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:37,203
change things like the font.
修改一些字体大小什么的。

880
00:44:37,205 --> 00:44:40,872
Let's make this be 24 point,
let's say.
让我们尝试下尺寸为24的。

881
00:44:40,874 --> 00:44:42,791
I can resize.
我能够修改尺寸。

882
00:44:42,792 --> 00:44:44,709
Notice that when I resize it
will actually
tell me the size,
注意，当我调整它时候，会显示尺寸。

883
00:44:44,711 --> 00:44:46,978
see it saying there what size it
is?
看到它说这是多大的尺寸

884
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,381
I can also set the size maybe
with this
size inspector right here,
我还可以在设置尺寸这里修改，

885
00:44:50,383 --> 00:44:51,348
type it in exactly.
类型的准备。

886
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,517
Maybe 64 by 64, something like
that.
也许64 x 64 看起来更合适。

887
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:54,918
We don't usually do that.
我们通常不这样做。

888
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,587
We want things to be kinda their
natural
sizes but
我们希望它能够是原始的大小，但

889
00:44:57,589 --> 00:45:01,156
just want to show you that there
are other
inspectors over here.
这里只想向你展示有其他的方法。

890
00:45:01,158 --> 00:45:02,491
So we have this 7.
所以我们有这个7。

891
00:45:02,493 --> 00:45:05,460
Now when this 7 is pressed, what
do we
want to happen?
当7被按下的时候，会发生什么呢？

892
00:45:05,462 --> 00:45:07,963
What we want.
我们想要的。

893
00:45:07,964 --> 00:45:10,465
Numbers just start appearing up
here in
the display, right?
数字出现在需要展示的地方。

894
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:13,000
So that's something our
controller is
going to have to do.
这就是我们的控制器不得不做的事。

895
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:17,071
So, when we touch this button,
we kinda
want this button to send a
message to
当我们点击这个按钮，我们想让这个按钮发送信息到

896
00:45:17,073 --> 00:45:21,307
our controller, and we do that
the exact
same way as we did this one,
我们的控制器，跟之前的方式一样，

897
00:45:21,309 --> 00:45:25,911
we hold down control, drag into
our code.
我们按住Ctrl，点击，拖动到代码中。

898
00:45:25,913 --> 00:45:29,248
When we let go though, we're not
going to
an outlet connection this time,
当我们松开时候，我们不想要outlet这个，

899
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:34,085
because I dont want an instance
variable
here, what i want is a method,
right?
因为此时我不想要一个实例变量，我需要一个方法。

900
00:45:34,087 --> 00:45:39,790
A function on my class, a
method, everyone
understand the word method I
hope,

901
00:45:39,792 --> 00:45:44,161
okay, so we want it to send an
[INAUDIBLE]
message to our control board, so

902
00:45:44,163 --> 00:45:48,831
I'm going to pick" action",
[COUGH] losing
my voice here.

903
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,433
Bad time to have a little cold,
but.

904
00:45:50,435 --> 00:45:52,968
[SOUND] So I'm doing an action
so

905
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:56,838
an action is a little different
than a
outlet, okay?

906
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,973
An outlet means an instance
variable or

907
00:45:58,975 --> 00:46:01,909
property, action means create a
method for
me.

908
00:46:01,911 --> 00:46:03,944
So again it wants to know the
name of the
method.

909
00:46:03,946 --> 00:46:05,512
So what does this thing do?

910
00:46:05,514 --> 00:46:08,815
Well when I press seven, it
appends a
digit onto the end of

911
00:46:08,817 --> 00:46:12,852
whatever's already in the
display, so I'm
going to call it append,

912
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:17,390
I could call it append seven,
but I'm
actually going to call it append
digit,

913
00:46:17,392 --> 00:46:20,859
because I want to have one
method that all
of my buttons use.

914
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,328
All right?

915
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:25,796
I don't want to, copy and
pasting a bunch
of methods, that would be really
bad code.

916
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,566
But if I'm gonna have one
method,

917
00:46:29,568 --> 00:46:33,437
then I need to know which button
is
sending me this message, okay?

918
00:46:33,439 --> 00:46:37,073
Luckily, when you haven't
actioned a
message being sent here,

919
00:46:37,075 --> 00:46:40,977
you can specify that it has
arguments, you
see right here where it says
arguments?

920
00:46:40,979 --> 00:46:45,414
And it can have no arguments or
it can
have the sender.

921
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:48,483
Which is the button here as the
argument.

922
00:46:48,485 --> 00:46:52,787
The only tricky thing here is,
and I'm not
sure why they did this in Xcode.

923
00:46:52,789 --> 00:46:54,455
Hopefully, they'll change it in
the
future.

924
00:46:54,457 --> 00:46:59,092
By default, the type of that
argument,
which is right here, is any
object.

925
00:46:59,094 --> 00:47:01,961
Now, we're gonna talk about any
object
next week.

926
00:47:01,963 --> 00:47:04,330
But, we don't want any object
here.

927
00:47:04,332 --> 00:47:06,599
We know that the sender is a UI
button, so

928
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:09,935
I picked, click this little blue
thing and
switch this to UI button.

929
00:47:09,937 --> 00:47:13,672
When you're doing your homework,
if you
forget to switch that to UI
button,

930
00:47:13,674 --> 00:47:15,907
you'll be sad, okay.

931
00:47:15,909 --> 00:47:17,541
So don't forget.

932
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:21,978
And obviously the event that the
message
is gonna be sent on, touch up
inside,

933
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,448
just means the user touched on
this button
and the touch went up.

934
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:27,116
While it was still inside the
button.

935
00:47:27,118 --> 00:47:29,952
That's all a touch up inside
means there.

936
00:47:29,954 --> 00:47:32,021
All right so when I connect
this,

937
00:47:32,023 --> 00:47:35,824
I'm gonna get a method with one
argument
which is a sender which is a UI
button.

938
00:47:35,826 --> 00:47:38,760
So let's take a look.

939
00:47:38,761 --> 00:47:41,695
So here's your first method
declaration in
SWIFT, okay?

940
00:47:41,698 --> 00:47:46,133
Again it's got this little IB
action thing
which is kinda like IB outlet.

941
00:47:46,135 --> 00:47:47,967
It puts a little dot in the
gutter.

942
00:47:49,104 --> 00:47:50,436
Okay?
So that you can

943
00:47:50,438 --> 00:47:52,938
see what this thing is connected
to.

944
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:59,010
So this is the normal, Swift
method
syntax.

945
00:47:59,012 --> 00:48:02,213
Starts with func because
function,

946
00:48:02,215 --> 00:48:04,215
basically that method is a
function in
class.

947
00:48:04,217 --> 00:48:06,483
[COUGH] Here's the name.

948
00:48:06,485 --> 00:48:07,918
Append digit.

949
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,987
And then in parentheses, all the
arguments
separated by commas.

950
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:12,989
We only have one argument,
though.

951
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:15,057
Here's the name of the first
argument.

952
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:18,860
That's the name we're going to
use to
access it inside of our method,
and

953
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:20,295
here is the type.

954
00:48:21,264 --> 00:48:22,496
Okay?
It's a UI button.

955
00:48:22,498 --> 00:48:24,598
I, notice no exclamation point
there, by
the way.

956
00:48:26,535 --> 00:48:31,237
Okay if this had a return value,
if this
method returned something this
one doesn't

957
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:36,208
[COUGH] but if it returned
something, it
would look like this arrow the
return type

958
00:48:37,745 --> 00:48:40,311
okay so that's how you specify a
return
type.

959
00:48:42,215 --> 00:48:48,185
Okay, pretty simple the syntax
and then
inside here we just type,

960
00:48:48,187 --> 00:48:51,822
well whatever we want this thing
to do
when one of these buttons is
touched.

961
00:48:51,824 --> 00:48:53,774
So what do we want it to do?

962
00:48:53,775 --> 00:48:55,725
Well, okay, first of all before
we do
that, let's go ahead and make
more of

963
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:58,928
these buttons because I need
seven, eight,
nine, four, five, six, all this.

964
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:01,664
So let's copy and paste the
button.

965
00:49:01,666 --> 00:49:04,400
When I copy and

966
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:07,135
paste the button, notice I'm
using the
blue lines to put it perfectly
lined up.

967
00:49:07,138 --> 00:49:11,373
Okay, also notice that it there
also
sending this message.

968
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:14,776
All right, see how their both
sending the
message, because when I copy and

969
00:49:14,778 --> 00:49:18,012
paste, it copied that aspect of
it as
well.

970
00:49:18,014 --> 00:49:21,182
So there's another one, I could
select all
three of these and

971
00:49:21,184 --> 00:49:27,154
copy and paste, okay, I could
select all
six of these and copy and paste.

972
00:49:27,156 --> 00:49:30,990
So I can quickly make, my entire
keypad.

973
00:49:30,992 --> 00:49:33,343
Just need to edit the title.

974
00:49:33,344 --> 00:49:35,695
Now, if while I'm editing these
titles,
sometimes you're clicking around
in

975
00:49:35,697 --> 00:49:39,431
here and, you know, you're not a
very
accurate clicker.

976
00:49:39,433 --> 00:49:43,368
[LAUGH] Or, you know, you just
get out,
out of control clicking here,
and oh,

977
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:45,236
you moved it out of the way.

978
00:49:45,238 --> 00:49:46,821
Okay?

979
00:49:46,822 --> 00:49:48,405
No problem, you can just put it
right back
in.

980
00:49:48,408 --> 00:49:51,675
Okay, use the blue lines to your
advantage.

981
00:49:52,844 --> 00:49:55,278
And we'll put our zero down
here.

982
00:49:55,279 --> 00:49:57,713
And I don't need these buttons
so I'm just
hit, selecting it, hitting
delete.

983
00:49:57,716 --> 00:49:59,715
That's how you can get rid of
something.

984
00:49:59,717 --> 00:50:02,985
And I promised I was gonna put
these all
on blue lines, so I'm gonna do
that.

985
00:50:02,987 --> 00:50:05,921
I'm gonna put it right
underneath the
zero.

986
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:08,890
So here's a blue line that means
underneath the zero, and

987
00:50:08,892 --> 00:50:10,692
then I'm going to put at this
edge.

988
00:50:10,694 --> 00:50:14,962
So now you can see that the blue
lines are
not just the edges, but

989
00:50:14,964 --> 00:50:17,965
they are other objects, like the
other
objects in the keypad and

990
00:50:17,967 --> 00:50:20,667
also now the title, the display
rather at
the top.

991
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:26,205
So I've got all these buttons,
they're all
sending this message append
digit.

992
00:50:26,207 --> 00:50:28,874
So I need to figure out which
one is
sending it,

993
00:50:28,876 --> 00:50:30,942
so that I can do the right
thing.

994
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:33,611
So let's start writing some code
inside
the method.

995
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:37,281
So the first thing I'm going to
do is
declare a local variable,

996
00:50:37,283 --> 00:50:39,917
it's just a local variable
inside this
method.

997
00:50:39,919 --> 00:50:43,520
I'm going to do that by saying
let digit
equal.

998
00:50:43,522 --> 00:50:47,824
So I want this local variable to
be the
digit that was pressed.

999
00:50:47,826 --> 00:50:50,743
Okay.

1000
00:50:50,744 --> 00:50:53,661
So, first thing that's quite
different
here is, what's let?

1001
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:54,363
Okay?

1002
00:50:54,365 --> 00:50:56,999
Why isn't this var, right?

1003
00:50:57,001 --> 00:51:00,735
Cuz var means variable, what the
heck does
let mean?

1004
00:51:00,737 --> 00:51:05,973
Well let is exactly the same as
var except
it's a constant.

1005
00:51:07,143 --> 00:51:10,744
Which means you're going to sign
this
right off the bat, and

1006
00:51:10,746 --> 00:51:13,046
it's never going to change in
this method.

1007
00:51:13,048 --> 00:51:15,415
Now Swift makes a big deal about
this, and

1008
00:51:15,417 --> 00:51:19,552
I love this feature, because if
I'm
reading this code,

1009
00:51:19,554 --> 00:51:23,355
I know the digit is never going
to change
all, this might be, you know.

1010
00:51:23,357 --> 00:51:24,856
It might have a dozen lines of
code.

1011
00:51:24,858 --> 00:51:26,792
Which by the way,

1012
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:28,727
you shouldn't have very many
methods, with
many more lines of code then
that.

1013
00:51:28,729 --> 00:51:30,294
Okay?
You want people to be able to

1014
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:31,796
kind of see what a method's
doing.

1015
00:51:33,232 --> 00:51:34,765
You can use other methods,

1016
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:37,801
call other methods if you need
to get more
code in there.

1017
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:38,935
so.

1018
00:51:38,937 --> 00:51:39,835
Here I can de-,

1019
00:51:39,837 --> 00:51:41,270
rely on that not changing.

1020
00:51:41,272 --> 00:51:44,406
That's big for readability.

1021
00:51:44,407 --> 00:51:47,541
You'll be surprised how much
more readable
it makes the code, to know that
this is a,

1022
00:51:47,544 --> 00:51:49,177
local variable, but it's
constant.

1023
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:50,111
Only set at the beginning.

1024
00:51:50,113 --> 00:51:52,913
Yeah.
Is there a reason, constants and

1025
00:51:52,915 --> 00:51:54,715
like, variables have the same
naming
convention.

1026
00:51:54,717 --> 00:51:56,450
Since [UNKNOWN] like Java there.

1027
00:51:56,451 --> 00:51:58,184
Like the naming conventions like
all caps
or lowercase.

1028
00:51:58,186 --> 00:52:00,770
Yeah.
So, yeah.

1029
00:52:00,771 --> 00:52:03,355
The question is, why don't I
call digit
like all caps digit, or

1030
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:05,424
something like that, so I know
it's a
constant.

1031
00:52:05,426 --> 00:52:07,626
That would be a programming
style thing.

1032
00:52:07,628 --> 00:52:10,929
Generally in Swift they don't do
that.

1033
00:52:10,931 --> 00:52:13,765
And, I'll show you why that is
in a
moment.

1034
00:52:13,767 --> 00:52:15,233
Why you don't really need to do
that.

1035
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:18,069
Because you can very quickly
find out the
declaration of

1036
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:22,406
any symbol anywhere with one
click, and
you'll see that.

1037
00:52:22,408 --> 00:52:25,209
Good question though.

1038
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:28,011
All right, so I wanna let the
digit, equal
the number that's on the,

1039
00:52:28,013 --> 00:52:30,196
the sending button.

1040
00:52:30,197 --> 00:52:32,380
So I'm gonna have to send a
message to
this button.

1041
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,316
Okay?
Gonna have to somehow access
this button.

1042
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:37,886
So I'm gonna have to do sender,
something.

1043
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:40,655
Give me what your title is,
okay?

1044
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:44,091
So this is a good time to talk
about the
documentation.

1045
00:52:44,093 --> 00:52:45,543
[COUGH].

1046
00:52:45,544 --> 00:52:46,994
Because being a good iOS
developer,

1047
00:52:46,996 --> 00:52:50,397
really demands that you are good
at
navigating the documentation.

1048
00:52:50,399 --> 00:52:54,334
Luckily, the documentation is
really well
plugged in to Xcode.

1049
00:52:54,336 --> 00:52:57,036
For example, if I wanna find out
about
button,

1050
00:52:57,038 --> 00:53:00,339
all I need to do is hold down
the option
key.

1051
00:53:00,341 --> 00:53:01,373
Okay?

1052
00:53:01,375 --> 00:53:02,974
And watch what happens now.

1053
00:53:02,976 --> 00:53:04,542
As I mouse over things,

1054
00:53:04,544 --> 00:53:09,680
everything, it turns blue with a
dashed
blue line under it, okay?

1055
00:53:09,682 --> 00:53:10,748
If I click on it,

1056
00:53:12,117 --> 00:53:14,884
it gives me a little blurb from
the
documentation about this thing.

1057
00:53:14,886 --> 00:53:17,954
So it's saying, you know,
here's, button
is a class.

1058
00:53:17,956 --> 00:53:19,288
Here's its inheritance.

1059
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:20,689
Here's a little bit of what it
does.

1060
00:53:20,691 --> 00:53:22,691
And really awesome at the bottom
here,

1061
00:53:22,693 --> 00:53:25,427
here's a link that takes you to
the
detailed documentation.

1062
00:53:25,429 --> 00:53:27,962
So I'm gonna click this little
link right
here.

1063
00:53:27,964 --> 00:53:34,501
It's going to be up a
documentation
window, with UI button in it,
hello?

1064
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:38,038
Did I not click that right thing
here,

1065
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:43,076
oh I hope I don't have a network
issue
here.

1066
00:53:43,078 --> 00:53:47,046
hm, okay well, I guess I'm not
connected
to the network,

1067
00:53:47,048 --> 00:53:50,149
that's the problem, so it's
getting this
off the network.

1068
00:53:50,151 --> 00:53:53,819
Okay so.

1069
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:57,488
Imagine that there were
documentation here
and, it would have along this
side here

1070
00:53:57,491 --> 00:54:03,294
on the left all the instance
variables or
properties and methods of u i
button.

1071
00:54:03,296 --> 00:54:05,929
And you could click on any one,
and

1072
00:54:05,931 --> 00:54:08,165
in there we'd have a full
description of
it here.

1073
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:11,735
And all the types that it
referenced you
could click on it here, and

1074
00:54:11,737 --> 00:54:14,504
basically it's a hyper linked
documentation [UNKNOWN].

1075
00:54:14,506 --> 00:54:16,773
As you can imagine.

1076
00:54:16,774 --> 00:54:19,041
I'll try to get the networking
working on
Wednesday and we'll take a look
at this.

1077
00:54:19,043 --> 00:54:21,494
But if I was looking in here,

1078
00:54:21,495 --> 00:54:23,946
I'd look down in the section
that says
getting the button's current
state, and

1079
00:54:23,948 --> 00:54:30,185
I'd find that there is an
instance
property there called current
title.

1080
00:54:30,187 --> 00:54:31,552
Okay?
It's unfortunate I'm not going
to

1081
00:54:31,554 --> 00:54:32,186
link these things.

1082
00:54:32,188 --> 00:54:33,687
But.

1083
00:54:33,689 --> 00:54:39,993
So how do we access, property or
call a
method in another object,

1084
00:54:39,995 --> 00:54:43,429
will look exactly the same
whether you
call it a method or

1085
00:54:43,431 --> 00:54:46,332
accessing a property, which is
you use
dot.

1086
00:54:46,334 --> 00:54:49,435
Okay.
It's the same syntax that's used
in

1087
00:54:49,437 --> 00:54:52,771
a lot of languages is to, to do
dot.

1088
00:54:52,773 --> 00:54:55,173
And so when you do that, Xcode
is going to
say, oh,

1089
00:54:55,175 --> 00:54:58,209
well, here's all the things
button knows
how to do.

1090
00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:59,894
Okay?

1091
00:54:59,895 --> 00:55:01,578
And as you can see, button knows
how to do
a lot of things.

1092
00:55:01,581 --> 00:55:03,747
Because it inherits from a
class, it
inherits from a class,

1093
00:55:03,749 --> 00:55:07,451
it inherits from a class, that
all have
lots of methods in them.

1094
00:55:07,453 --> 00:55:10,320
So when I looked at that
documentation.

1095
00:55:10,322 --> 00:55:13,823
I've found that current title
was the
thing I wanted.

1096
00:55:13,825 --> 00:55:18,194
Now notice as I start to type a
c, it's
already cutting down

1097
00:55:18,196 --> 00:55:23,331
the things that could be
starting with a
c, and then c u, they cut down
even more.

1098
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:28,770
I can type tab, to get to the
first
ambiguity point, then I can type
t.

1099
00:55:29,739 --> 00:55:31,889
Okay?

1100
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:34,040
And then tab again, and I'm here
at
current title and then I can
press return.

1101
00:55:35,243 --> 00:55:35,875
Okay?

1102
00:55:35,877 --> 00:55:37,327
So there it is.

1103
00:55:37,328 --> 00:55:38,778
Digit equals sender current
title.

1104
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:45,484
so, what's going on here in
terms of did,
descender title.

1105
00:55:45,486 --> 00:55:49,520
Let's go ahead and print this
out to the
console just to see what's going
on.

1106
00:55:49,522 --> 00:55:50,688
So I'm gonna print lin.

1107
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:55,992
At which is a function, a global
function
that takes a string.

1108
00:55:55,994 --> 00:55:57,694
So I give it a string.

1109
00:55:57,696 --> 00:55:59,762
And inside that string, I'll
type mm,

1110
00:55:59,764 --> 00:56:05,000
digit equals and now I wanna
embed the
value of digit in this string.

1111
00:56:05,002 --> 00:56:08,337
And Swift has a really cool
feature which
is backslash open parentheses

1112
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:11,924
close parentheses.

1113
00:56:11,925 --> 00:56:15,510
If you put that in a string, and
then
inside there you put some
expression, then

1114
00:56:15,512 --> 00:56:21,048
it will evaluate that expression
turn it
into a string, and embed it in
the string.

1115
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:24,718
Okay, so its really easy to
print lin
values by

1116
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,487
using this backslash
parenthesis.

1117
00:56:27,489 --> 00:56:28,254
Okay?

1118
00:56:28,256 --> 00:56:30,189
So let's go ahead and run and

1119
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:32,123
see what happens when we press
these
buttons to see what kind of
result we get.

1120
00:56:32,126 --> 00:56:35,027
It's not going to be quite what
we expect,
but let's see.

1121
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:42,066
Alright so, here's our BUY we
got our
buttons that's a good start.

1122
00:56:42,068 --> 00:56:44,435
And now, and console, where's
the console?

1123
00:56:44,437 --> 00:56:46,269
Watch this.
I'm going to press a button
five.

1124
00:56:47,372 --> 00:56:49,238
The console appears at the
bottom here.

1125
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,172
See this down here.

1126
00:56:50,174 --> 00:56:51,874
This is the console.

1127
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:56,277
And it's saying digit equals,
hm, optional
five.

1128
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:57,211
Okay.

1129
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:58,746
How about a nine?

1130
00:56:58,748 --> 00:56:59,713
They're all optional.

1131
00:56:59,715 --> 00:57:01,081
What the heck is going on here?

1132
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:03,250
Okay.

1133
00:57:03,251 --> 00:57:05,418
This is crucial to understanding
Swift.

1134
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:08,421
This is probably the most
important thing
to understand that

1135
00:57:08,423 --> 00:57:11,424
people don't quite get right
from the
start.

1136
00:57:11,426 --> 00:57:15,827
So we're really going to focus
here on
understanding what

1137
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:17,862
optional means right there.

1138
00:57:17,864 --> 00:57:18,730
Okay?

1139
00:57:18,731 --> 00:57:19,597
So let's go back to our code.

1140
00:57:22,168 --> 00:57:25,969
And look at this, oh and by the
way it,
when the console appears down
here,

1141
00:57:25,971 --> 00:57:28,538
you can make it go away with
this little
button, or

1142
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:31,274
you can just drag it out of the
way okay?

1143
00:57:31,276 --> 00:57:34,711
But sometimes it's nice to have
that
console still there, so

1144
00:57:34,713 --> 00:57:39,548
you can look at your output
while you're
you know reacting to whatever
you found,

1145
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,750
in fact we will leave that up
there, so
you can see the optionals.

1146
00:57:42,753 --> 00:57:45,186
Alright, so, what's going on
here?

1147
00:57:45,188 --> 00:57:48,956
Well, what's happening here is,
well,
first of all,

1148
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:52,759
don't you find this a little bit
odd, let
digit, I didn't put a type.

1149
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:55,595
You see that?

1150
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,663
How, what type is digit?

1151
00:57:57,665 --> 00:58:02,334
Okay, well there's no type in
there, no
type information whatsoever, so.

1152
00:58:02,336 --> 00:58:04,636
Does Swift have untyped
variables?

1153
00:58:04,638 --> 00:58:06,171
No, it's exact opposite.

1154
00:58:06,173 --> 00:58:08,940
Swift is very strongly typed.

1155
00:58:08,942 --> 00:58:10,141
Okay.

1156
00:58:10,142 --> 00:58:11,341
All variables have a type.

1157
00:58:11,344 --> 00:58:12,943
You have to specify type.

1158
00:58:12,945 --> 00:58:17,847
But, Swift is also incredibly
good at
what's called type inference.

1159
00:58:17,849 --> 00:58:20,817
So it can infer the type from
the context.

1160
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:25,554
So here I let digit equal
whatever this
is, this current title, and

1161
00:58:25,556 --> 00:58:29,391
so it just made digit be the
same type as
this.

1162
00:58:29,393 --> 00:58:31,543
Okay.

1163
00:58:31,544 --> 00:58:33,694
Now back to the question
earlier, so what
type is that?

1164
00:58:33,697 --> 00:58:37,365
Well, if I hold down option,
okay, just
like we used option to

1165
00:58:37,367 --> 00:58:42,636
go look into the documentation,
we can
also option click on our own
variables.

1166
00:58:42,638 --> 00:58:44,337
To see are they constant?

1167
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:45,204
Are they variables?

1168
00:58:45,206 --> 00:58:46,138
And what type are they?

1169
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,306
So watch this.

1170
00:58:47,308 --> 00:58:50,225
Option click.

1171
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:53,143
It says digit is of type string
question
mark.

1172
00:58:53,146 --> 00:58:54,579
Okay?
String question mark.

1173
00:58:55,515 --> 00:58:58,248
That question mark means
optional.

1174
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:02,585
So there is a type in Swift,
it's a type,
called optional.

1175
00:59:02,587 --> 00:59:04,087
Okay.

1176
00:59:04,089 --> 00:59:08,257
Optional, that type can have
only two
values.

1177
00:59:08,259 --> 00:59:10,592
One value is not set.

1178
00:59:12,095 --> 00:59:16,997
Okay, this optional is not set,
there has
never been set or someone has

1179
00:59:16,999 --> 00:59:20,934
set it to the not set state,
they unset it
if you want to think about it
that way.

1180
00:59:20,936 --> 00:59:25,405
So optional one value is not
set, we call
that there's a, symbol for

1181
00:59:25,407 --> 00:59:28,241
it in here called nil, N, I, L,
okay?

1182
00:59:28,243 --> 00:59:31,210
That means not set, that's the
value of an
optional not set.

1183
00:59:31,212 --> 00:59:34,747
That's the only thing nil means
in Swift
is option this is an optional,

1184
00:59:34,749 --> 00:59:36,948
the value of an optional that is
not set.

1185
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:41,586
What's the other value that an
optional
could have well the other value
is.

1186
00:59:41,588 --> 00:59:44,655
Something, it's set to
something, okay.

1187
00:59:44,657 --> 00:59:47,624
And the type of that something
is what,

1188
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:51,261
is specified next to the
question mark
string.

1189
00:59:51,263 --> 00:59:55,932
So really you can almost think
of the
question mark there, that's the
type

1190
00:59:55,934 --> 01:00:00,769
optional, and that string to the
left is
just saying if this optional is
set,

1191
01:00:00,771 --> 01:00:04,139
what type of thing is it set to,
in this
case a string.

1192
01:00:04,141 --> 01:00:06,941
So we would call this an
optional string.

1193
01:00:06,943 --> 01:00:11,846
But it's really an optional,
it's not a
string that can be nil,

1194
01:00:11,848 --> 01:00:14,815
it's an optional that can be a
string.

1195
01:00:14,817 --> 01:00:16,516
Everybody cool with that
sentence?

1196
01:00:16,518 --> 01:00:19,019
That's an important sentence to
understand, okay.

1197
01:00:20,055 --> 01:00:23,956
So, this got to be an optional
because
this current title method right
here,

1198
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:26,525
returns an optional string,
let's look at
that.

1199
01:00:26,527 --> 01:00:29,094
So I'm going to Alt+Option down
here,
click.

1200
01:00:29,096 --> 01:00:31,529
Look at this, this is the documentation for it.
看这里，这里是它的文档。

1201
01:00:31,531 --> 01:00:36,334
It's an instance variable a, a,
property
on UI button.
这是一个实例变量，UIButton的属性

1202
01:00:36,336 --> 01:00:37,267
Name is current title.
名字是current title

1203
01:00:37,269 --> 01:00:39,302
The type is string, question mark.
类型是string，问号标记。

1204
01:00:39,304 --> 01:00:41,271
And this little get means it's read-only.
而这里的“get”表示这个是只读的。

1205
01:00:41,273 --> 01:00:42,672
I can only get the current title.
我只能获得current title。

1206
01:00:42,674 --> 01:00:44,807
I can't set it, there are other ways to set a button's title.
但是我不能设置，有其他方式进行设置。

1207
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:47,810
You can't set it with this method or this property.
你不能通过这个方法或者属性进行设置。

1208
01:00:47,812 --> 01:00:51,480
So it's an optional, so that's why this ended up being an optional all right.
所以这是一个选项，这就是为什么最后是一个选项。

1209
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:53,081
Well, that's all wonderful.
嗯，这非常不错。

1210
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,549
How do I get the string?
我怎么获取这个string呢？

1211
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:57,318
I don't want it optional, I want that button's string.
我不需要它的选项，我要的是这个按钮的标题。

1212
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:02,923
And the way you do that is you unwrap the optional, meaning you look in there and
方法就是你可以打开这个方法，意思是你正在

1213
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:08,061
get the val, the associated value, with exclamation point, okay.
用“!”从里边获取关联的值。

1214
01:01:08,063 --> 01:01:11,330
What happens if I put that exclamation point there?
如果我把感叹号放在这里会怎么样？

1215
01:01:11,332 --> 01:01:13,732
Well first of all, let me show you that when I put that exclamation point,
首先我先会展示给你们看，我把感叹号放在这里

1216
01:01:13,734 --> 01:01:17,002
look what happened to digit, I'm Option-clicking on digit.
看看会有什么变化，我现在点击数字。

1217
01:01:17,004 --> 01:01:19,270
It's not an optional anymore.
它不再是选项了。

1218
01:01:19,272 --> 01:01:22,507
Digit turned to a string because I unwrapped the optional that
数字变成了string，因为我打开了选项

1219
01:01:22,509 --> 01:01:25,576
came back from current title, got the string out of there.
从当前的标题里的到了string。

1220
01:01:25,578 --> 01:01:28,612
But what happens if this is nil?
但是如果这是个nil值会怎么样？

1221
01:01:28,614 --> 01:01:30,180
What happened if this optional is nil?
如果选项是nil会发生什么事情？

1222
01:01:30,182 --> 01:01:34,718
In other words the button option has never been set, crash, 'kay,
换句话说，就是这些按钮选项没有设置会怎么样？对的，会崩溃。

1223
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:39,855
crashes your program, so if you use exclamation point to unwrap an optional,
所以如果你使用"!"号来打开一个选项的时候。

1224
01:01:39,857 --> 01:01:45,660
and that optional's current value is not set, nil, then it will crash your program.
并且这个选项没有设值为空的时候，你的程序会崩溃。

1225
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:50,498
Now a lot of you might be like whoa, I'm, my products are gonna be crashing all over
现在你们中的不少人肯定在想，怎么我的东西老是崩溃？

1226
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:55,903
the place and, because there's a lot of optionals in iOS, I mean a lot, okay?
这是因为iOS有着非常多的选项，记住是非常多。

1227
01:01:55,905 --> 01:01:58,939
Most things are probably optionals, because most things, it make sense,
多数东西都是选项，因为这些东西都是有意义的。

1228
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:00,840
they can be in an not set state at some point.
他们能在一些情况下出于不需设值的状态。

1229
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:07,746
And yeah, in this case though, maybe you want your program to crash, okay?
在这个情况下，说不定你就希望你的程序崩溃？对不对？

1230
01:02:07,748 --> 01:02:11,850
You might want your program to crash, because if you had a button, that never
你也许就是希望自己的程序崩溃，因为你有一个按键，

1231
01:02:11,852 --> 01:02:15,920
had its title set, and it's sending a pen digit to your controller, you probably
但是它的标题从未设值，并且它传了一个数字给你的控制器

1232
01:02:15,922 --> 01:02:20,358
wanna have that crash, so you can find that bug, before you ship your program.
在你分发你的程序之前，你就能找到bug，所以你希望它崩溃。

1233
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,360
You see why sometimes fra, crashing is good?
现在你知道为什么有时候程序崩溃是个好事吧。

1234
01:02:23,362 --> 01:02:26,763
Now if you don't wanna crash, there's a way to get around that as well.
现在如果你不想你的程序崩溃，这里有一个方法来解决。

1235
01:02:26,765 --> 01:02:28,164
And I'll show you that a little bit later.
我等一下就和你们说。

1236
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:32,802
But for now understanding that that's what this exclamation point does.
但是现在，先弄明白这个感叹号是干什么的。

1237
01:02:32,804 --> 01:02:35,638
It unwraps that optional and crashes if it's nil.
它打开了选项，如果它是nil就崩溃。

1238
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,040
But if it's not nil, it gets to the string or
但如果不是空，它是得到string还是

1239
01:02:38,042 --> 01:02:40,809
whatever the optional type is out of there for you.
给你其他的选项类型？

1240
01:02:40,811 --> 01:02:44,579
So now let's go ahead and run again and
所以让我们继续，重新运行一次

1241
01:02:44,581 --> 01:02:51,318
we're gonna see that digit equals is gonna say the number, 'kay?
我们将看看是不是能得到相等的数字？

1242
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:56,556
It's got the string off the current title, no more optional in there, okay?
我们得到了当前的标题，没有更多的选项了。

1243
01:02:56,558 --> 01:02:59,492
Good?
看上去不错。

1244
01:02:59,494 --> 01:03:03,362
All right, so, now, what are we gonna do with that digit?
好的，现在，我们要用这些按钮做什么呢？

1245
01:03:03,364 --> 01:03:06,715
We got the digit,
我们已经能得到数字。

1246
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:10,067
we want to append it onto the end of this display right here, okay.
我们希望按的数字能显示在这里的末尾。

1247
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:13,972
And so let's just do that by saying display, dot.
所以让我们输入display.

1248
01:03:13,974 --> 01:03:17,241
Now, again, if we have the documentation,I'd go look in the documentation and
现在继续，如果我们查文档。

1249
01:03:17,243 --> 01:03:21,712
it would say oh, there's a property on UILabel, which is what display is,
它会告诉我们，UILabel有一个属性

1250
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,046
display is a UILabel.
负责显示UILabel应该显示的什么。

1251
01:03:23,048 --> 01:03:25,982
There's a property and it' called text.
这个属性叫做text

1252
01:03:25,984 --> 01:03:28,518
See it right there?
就在这里。

1253
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:31,053
And actually, you can even see right here, the type of that, it's an optional as
而且实际上，输入这个，你能在这里看到，这是一个选项。

1254
01:03:31,056 --> 01:03:36,225
well, because this label's text might not have been set either, okay?
所以这个label的text还没有设值。

1255
01:03:36,227 --> 01:03:39,061
So it has to be an optional string, okay?
所以这里是选项string。

1256
01:03:39,063 --> 01:03:43,297
So I'm just gonna set that equal now, display that text as an optional, so
所以我现在要用等号设值，显示的text作为一个选项

1257
01:03:43,299 --> 01:03:46,567
what values can I send it to,set it to?
什么值可以设给它？

1258
01:03:46,569 --> 01:03:51,705
I could set it to nil, that would be legal because it's an optional,
我可以设成nil，因为它是一个选项，是完全合法的。

1259
01:03:51,707 --> 01:03:53,940
see, no warnings, no errors.
看，没有警告也没有错误。

1260
01:03:53,942 --> 01:03:55,475
That would clear out that display.
这将什么也不显示。

1261
01:03:55,477 --> 01:03:57,943
It would not be set to anything, or
它不能设值成其他东西

1262
01:03:57,945 --> 01:04:00,979
I can set it to a string because it's an optional string.
我能给它设一个string值，因为它是一个选项string。

1263
01:04:00,981 --> 01:04:03,682
So I'm going to set it to a string and the string I'm going to set it
所以我将把它设值一个string

1264
01:04:03,684 --> 01:04:08,586
to is display.text, what's currently in there, plus digit, okay?
这个string我设置成display.text，这里加个数字。

1265
01:04:08,588 --> 01:04:10,087
So I'm going to append that digit on.
这样子就能增加数字了。

1266
01:04:10,089 --> 01:04:11,655
Let's get rid of that.
让我们摆脱删掉这句。

1267
01:04:11,657 --> 01:04:14,124
Okay, now, this has an error here.
好吧，现在又有一个错误。

1268
01:04:14,126 --> 01:04:15,025
Why does this have an error?
这个错误是为什么呢？为什么这里有个错误呢？

1269
01:04:15,027 --> 01:04:17,093
Anyone volunteer why this is an error?
有谁自愿回答这里为什么有个错误？

1270
01:04:17,095 --> 01:04:18,661
See it's pointing right here. 
发现错误指向这里。

1271
01:04:18,663 --> 01:04:21,897
There's an error, back there.
这里有个错误，后面那位同学回答。

1272
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:24,733
The display.text is an optional string.
display.text是一个选项string。

1273
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:27,702
Bingo. Because display.text right here is not
答对了，因为这里的display.tex它不是个string。

1274
01:04:27,704 --> 01:04:33,341
a string, it's an optional, and you can't add a string to an optional.
你不能将一个string加在一个选项上。

1275
01:04:33,343 --> 01:04:35,476
You can only add strings to other strings.
你只能将一个string加在另外的string上。

1276
01:04:35,478 --> 01:04:39,813
So we need to turn this into a string by unwrapping it.
所以我们通过打开选项，将选项转变为string。

1277
01:04:39,815 --> 01:04:44,250
And again, yes, this would crash if the display currently has nothing in it,
对的，这个东西会crash，如果display没有值。

1278
01:04:44,252 --> 01:04:46,185
it's not set, okay?
现在还没有设值。

1279
01:04:46,187 --> 01:04:48,887
Are we cool with that? 
大家都了解这个了吧？

1280
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:49,821
So let's run again.
再让我们运行一次。

1281
01:04:49,823 --> 01:04:52,857
[BLANK_AUDIO]
[背景音]

1282
01:04:52,859 --> 01:04:54,058
All right.
好的。

1283
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:57,461
So now 5, oh, it put the 5 on there.
所以现在点击5，噢，5显示在这里了。

1284
01:04:57,463 --> 01:04:58,762
6, excellent.
点击6，好极了。

1285
01:04:58,764 --> 01:05:00,497
It's kinda working.
它能够工作了。

1286
01:05:00,499 --> 01:05:02,565
I don't really like that 0 though.
这个0在这里我很不喜欢。

1287
01:05:02,567 --> 01:05:03,966
That's kinda weak, 0, 5, 6.
这里就有点不对劲了，5和6前面有个0。

1288
01:05:03,968 --> 01:05:06,669
That should not,
这样子是不对的。

1289
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:09,371
that 0 should've gotten cleared out, right, when I first typed that 5.
这个0应该在我按下5的时候就清除掉。

1290
01:05:09,374 --> 01:05:12,808
And that's because we really need some way in our controller to know whether we're in
这是因为我们确实需要一些方法让我们的controller知道我们是否在

1291
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:14,777
the middle of typing a number right now.
一个数字膻中输入数字。

1292
01:05:14,778 --> 01:05:16,745
Because if we're in the middle of typing a number, we want to append, but
因为如果我们在一个已有数字中部输入数字，我们是希望数字加在输入的地方的。

1293
01:05:16,747 --> 01:05:18,079
if we're not in the middle of typing a number,
但是如果我们不用从一个数字的中部进行输入。

1294
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:21,182
we want to start a new number, right?
也就是我们想要从头开始输入一个新的数字。

1295
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:27,021
So, let's do that, and I'm going to do that by adding a property, okay?
所以，让我们通过添加一个属性实现这个效果。

1296
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:35,628
Var userIsInTheMiddleOfTypingANumber , which you might say,
设个叫做“userIsInTheMiddleOfTypingANumber”的变量，你也许会说

1297
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:38,464
oh my God, that terrible variable, now I have to type that over and over.
天哪，这么糟糕的变量名字，每次都得这么输入还不得累死？

1298
01:05:38,466 --> 01:05:40,900
This is the last time I'll ever have to type that, okay?
其实下次用到这个变量我可不需要输入这么多的。

1299
01:05:40,902 --> 01:05:44,169
Because Xcode is always going to escape complete it for me, okay?
因为下次用到Xcode会帮我自动补齐的。

1300
01:05:44,171 --> 01:05:48,840
So long names are perfectly fine, in terms of typing load anyway.
所以这么长的名字没有问题。

1301
01:05:48,842 --> 01:05:50,608
So I like this name so I'm gonna keep it.
我就挺喜欢这个名字的，就这么用了。

1302
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:53,077
And it's a bool, okay.
这是一个布尔型数值。

1303
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:54,845
So I'm typing its, giving its type.
所以输入它的类型。

1304
01:05:54,847 --> 01:06:01,618
So here's var name type, and notice, look at this little error right here, 'kay.
命名完变量的名字和类型，注意看这里，有一个小错误标记。

1305
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:06,222
Okay, sometimes you're gonna get errors in Swift that are completely incomprehensible
好吧，有时候你用Swift会遇到难以理解的错误。

1306
01:06:06,224 --> 01:06:08,724
to you because you haven't learned enough of Swift.
但是这是因为你对Swift的了解不够深入。

1307
01:06:08,726 --> 01:06:11,143
This one's kind of like that.
这个错误就是因为这个。

1308
01:06:11,144 --> 01:06:13,561
You see, it says, class view controller has no initializers.
你看，这里说类视图控制器没有初始化。

1309
01:06:13,564 --> 01:06:19,667
And that's because, and pay attention, in Swift all properties
请注意，这是因为，在Swift里

1310
01:06:19,669 --> 01:06:24,271
have to be initialized when the object is initialized.
一个对象没有初始化，那么对象的属性都不会初始化。

1311
01:06:24,273 --> 01:06:29,142
Okay, you can't have a property just sitting around not initialized,
所以你不能用没有初始化的属性。

1312
01:06:29,144 --> 01:06:30,977
they have to have a value.
它们需要一个值。

1313
01:06:30,979 --> 01:06:32,862
Now if they're an optional,
现在，它们是一个选项。

1314
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:34,746
their value can be nil, but they have to have some value.
它们的值可以为空，但是它们必须有值。

1315
01:06:34,749 --> 01:06:37,750
So we can't have this have no value.
所以我们不能在它们没有值前使用。

1316
01:06:37,752 --> 01:06:40,052
Now there's two ways to give it a value.
有两种方法给它设值。

1317
01:06:40,054 --> 01:06:42,087
One is, with an initializer.
一种就是用初始化。

1318
01:06:42,089 --> 01:06:45,156
Unfortunately, I'm not gonna teach that to you until next week, so
但是不幸的是，这个方法要下周才讲。

1319
01:06:45,158 --> 01:06:46,557
you can't do it that way.
你还不能用这个方法。

1320
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:51,228
Another way is just to say what it equals right here, okay?
所以另外一种方法就是对其直接赋值。

1321
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:55,298
And boom, gets rid of all our errors, obviously we don't start out in
一下子，  所有问题都解决了。

1322
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:59,402
the middle of typing a number,so we're good to go here, all right.
很明显用户不会从中间输入数字，所以从这一点出发

1323
01:07:01,105 --> 01:07:04,373
So now we have, we know whether the use is in the middle of typing a number.
现在我们知道了用户是否会从中间输入数字。

1324
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:06,241
We can go down here and say if the user,
我们能从这里继续深入，如果说用户

1325
01:07:06,243 --> 01:07:12,246
now again, I'm just gonna hit Tab to jump past this, maybe a couple times.
按一下Tab，可能要花点时间，找到这个

1326
01:07:12,248 --> 01:07:14,648
But if the user's in the middle of typing a number,
但是如果用户从中间输入数字。

1327
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:17,184
then we'll do what we were doing before.
那就和刚才我们已经做得一样处理。

1328
01:07:17,186 --> 01:07:21,187
Otherwise, we're just gonna set the display.text equal to the new digit we
另外，如果我们计划设置display.text为一个新的数字

1329
01:07:21,189 --> 01:07:24,557
just typed, 'kay?
只需要输入这个：

1330
01:07:24,558 --> 01:07:27,926
And we're gonna say that the user is now in the middle of typing a number.
这句表示用户现在在数字的中间输入数字。

1331
01:07:27,928 --> 01:07:30,062
Question?
什么问题？

1332
01:07:30,063 --> 01:07:32,197
Why would we have to do
[INAUDIBLE] to
display it?

1333
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:34,833
Initialize?

1334
01:07:34,835 --> 01:07:37,669
Why did we not have to initialize this?
为什么我们部初始化这个？

1335
01:07:37,671 --> 01:07:39,988
That's a fantastic question and
这是个不错的问题

1336
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:42,306
I'm gonna talk about that on Wednesday cuz there's only one minute left.
我将在下周三说这个问题，现在只剩下一分钟了。

1337
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,908
But that is a great question and it'll also, when I talk about it,
在我下次说到的时候，这依然是个很好的问题。

1338
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:48,679
I'm gonna tell you why this is an exclamation point and not a question mark.
我说一下为什么这里是个感叹号而不是个问好。

1339
01:07:48,681 --> 01:07:52,548
Because I told you that optionals are made with question marks.
因为我之前说过选项都是用问号标记的。

1340
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:55,318
So why the heck is this optional?
但是为什么这个东西是选项

1341
01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:58,087
Cuz that's what it is, an exclamation point, so we'll talk about that next time.
因为可是个感叹号，我们下次课再说这个问题。

1342
01:07:58,089 --> 01:08:01,056
All right, so let's go ahead and run one last time here.
所以让我们下次课继续。

1343
01:08:01,058 --> 01:08:04,793
And hopefully this is gonna, this 0 will be cleared out, it is and
我们之前希望这个0可以正确的清除掉，看来没问题，看看这个

1344
01:08:04,795 --> 01:08:07,696
hopefully this will continue to append, it is.
希望这个可以正常的增加，看来也没问题。

1345
01:08:07,698 --> 01:08:11,532
So we're in a great spot right here, we've got a calculator,
我们今天已经有了一个不错的开始，我们将会做一个计算器。

1346
01:08:11,534 --> 01:08:16,904
we can enter numbers in it, next step is, we gotta make it do some calculating, and
我们已经能够输入数字了，下一步我们将让其能够计算。

1347
01:08:16,906 --> 01:08:19,406
we're gonna do that next time so I will see you then.
我们下节课再做，大家下节课见。

>> Welcome to Stanford CS193P,this is winter quarter 2015.
欢迎参加斯坦福大学2015年冬季学期的CS193P课程。

5
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:21,718
And we're gonna dive right in today to some brief slide work.
我们首先简要的看一下今天课程的内容

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,221
This people at Stanford, you've got a document that describe,
斯坦福的学生，你们都有一份文档，

7
00:00:26,223 --> 00:00:28,357
describes all the grading and all that stuff
里面有每个学期所有东西的描述

8
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,126
so I'm not gonna go over that in lecture like I often do to start the quarter.
所以我不想像以往开课那样说一些乱七八糟的东西。

9
00:00:33,663 --> 00:00:36,296
Instead I'm gonna talk a little bit about, what this class is about.
相反我首先要谈一谈关于本课程的内容。

10
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:42,068
Brief mention of the prerequisites cuz they're pretty important in this class.
接下来要提一下学习本课程的先决条件，

11
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,870
Then just the [NOISE] quickest overview of iOS.
然后会对IOS进行快速的预览。

12
00:00:44,872 --> 00:00:49,508
I'm gonna assume that anyone who is here or is watching this, knows what that is.
我想在座各位或者观看视频的同学都知道那是什么吧。

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,609
And then, we're gonna dive right into a big old demo.
再然后，我们会演示一个大的Demo。

14
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:54,779
It's gonna be a two-day thing, where I'm really going to try and
这将是一个为期两天的事情，我将

15
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:57,381
introduce you to Xcode and the development environment and
向你们介绍XCode，开发环境，

16
00:00:57,383 --> 00:01:01,818
this language Swift, that you're gonna have to learn to develop for iOS.
和Swift语言，同学们将学会用这些工具来为IOS做开发。

17
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,120
All right, so what is this class about?
好了，那么本课程是讲什么的呢？

18
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:06,455
It's about building cool apps, as we know.
它是讲关于创建我们知道的一些很酷的应用的课程。

19
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:09,091
Why are these iOS apps so cool?
为什么这些IOS应用如此之酷？

20
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:11,960
Well, because the device you're gonna run them on is in your pocket or
因为运行这些应用的设备要么在你的口袋里，

21
00:01:11,962 --> 00:01:14,229
in your backpack.
要么在你的背包里。

22
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,497
Either, if you write an app, you can just pull it out and show your friends and
如果你写了一个应用，你可以将它展示给你的朋友

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,535
it's highly networked and incredible graphics with animation.
它是高度网络化的，并有令人难以置信的图形和动画效果。

24
00:01:20,537 --> 00:01:23,371
It's just cool all the way around and I think you guys all know that or
它在各个方面都很酷。我想你们应该都知道这些，

25
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:24,605
you wouldn't be here.
否则你们就不会坐在这里了。

26
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:26,490
But you're also gonna learn in
但是你们可能要学习一些

27
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,374
this class a lot of real life Object-Oriented Programming.
关于面向对象编程的知识。

28
00:01:28,377 --> 00:01:32,578
You're taking a lot of other classes here at Stanford on things like graphics, and
你们也可能在斯坦福选一些有关于图形、

29
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,849
networking, and databases, and maybe animation.
网络、数据库、动画

30
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:39,718
Things like that.
或者其他类似的课程。

31
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,586
And we're gonna is kinda tie that all together into a real world class.
然而我们将这些内容融合在一起，

32
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:44,055
'Kay? You're gonna get to see all this stuff.
你们会在本课程内看到所有这些东西。

33
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:46,891
Now, you know, it's gonna be kind of a survey course in that,
现在，你应该知道这会是一个概述型课程，

34
00:01:46,893 --> 00:01:49,426
I can't go too deep into networking.
我不会深入讲述网络的内容，

35
00:01:49,428 --> 00:01:52,462
I can't go too deep into databases.
我不会深入讲述数据库的内容，

36
00:01:52,464 --> 00:01:56,366
I can't go too deep into animation, but you'll get to see it all in a really real
我不会深入讲述动画的内容，但是你们会在

37
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:59,569
world environment, where people out there building apps using that technology.
真实项目的环境中用到所有的这些技术。

38
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:03,906
For some of you who haven't seen that before that'll be a big bonus of
我认为，对于一些之前没有接触过这些的同学，

39
00:02:03,908 --> 00:02:04,940
this class, I think.
本课程对他们会有很大的提升。

40
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:07,975
The prerequisites of this class.
学习本课程的先决条件。

41
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:11,712
Number one thing is you have to be a pretty strong Object-Oriented programmer.
最重要的，你要是一个很给力的面向对象开发者。

42
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,014
If you're not a strong Object-Oriented programmer, and
如果你不是，

43
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:18,018
you hit this class, you're probably gonna go under water, pretty quick.
还选了这个课，基本上你就要挂了，很快。

44
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,519
Okay? I'm gonna assume you know,
我需要你知道

45
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:22,188
everything about Object-Oriented Programming.
关于面向对象编程的一切。

46
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,456
IOS is a completely Object-Oriented Programming envir,
IOS是一个完全的面向对象编程的环...

47
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,658
development environment,
额，开发环境，

48
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:28,859
I just don't mean I'm not just talking about the language is Object-Oriented.
我的意思不是说，我说的不只是编程语言是面向对象的。

49
00:02:28,862 --> 00:02:31,863
But the entire design of it the way you use it if you're not
整个的设计方式都是面向对象的。如果你不能

50
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:33,965
comfortable with things like subclassing and
熟练的使用像是子类之类的东西，

51
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:37,935
stuff like that then you're just really gonna be behind the curve.
那么你真的离挂科不远了。

52
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:42,239
In iOS so at Stanford here that means CS16A and B or
斯坦福的IOS相关课程有CS16A，CA16B或者

53
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:47,344
CS16X, and then you know, CS107, while it's not really Object-Oriented course,
CS16X，以及众所周知的CS107，虽然它并不是专门的面向对象课程，

54
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:49,746
at least it's a heavy duty programming course.
但至少是一门重量级的编程课程。

55
00:02:49,748 --> 00:02:52,615
CS108 is a great Object-Oriented course so
CS108是非常好的面向对象课程，所以

56
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:55,918
if you have, if you've taken CS108 you'll probably, be really well prepped.
如果你曾经，如果你上过CS108，你可能会觉得很轻松。

57
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,555
110, again not really too much an Object-Oriented program but
110，同样也不是非常专门的面向对象课程，

58
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:03,057
good programming course cuz there's a lot of programming in this class,
但同样是一门非常好的编程课程，因为其中有大量的编程实践。

59
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:05,159
in fact, all the work in this class is programming.
事实上，所有这些课程的内容都是关于编程的。

60
00:03:05,161 --> 00:03:08,395
You will not have, a little bit of reading the first couple of weeks just to
在头几个星期，你仅仅

61
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:12,299
kinda learn this new language, but it's almost all programming after that all
只会学到一点这个新语言的内容，但是直到课程结束

62
00:03:12,301 --> 00:03:14,467
the way til the end, including your final project.
所有的编程任务都需要它，包括你们的最终项目。

63
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:17,804
So if you're not really comfortable with all these terms,
所以，如果你真的不适应面向对象编程，

64
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:21,674
this Object-Oriented terms or if you're just not really comfortable with
或者你真的只是不喜欢写大程序，

65
00:03:21,676 --> 00:03:26,178
writing big programs then this class will definitely be a challenge for you.
那么这个课程对你来说就是一个挑战。

66
00:03:27,848 --> 00:03:30,682
okay, so what's in iOS, what are the parts of it?
那么，IOS中有什么？都包括哪些部分呢？

67
00:03:30,684 --> 00:03:34,085
You know, it's ha, it's such a big system, it's got so much in it.
它是...哈，它是一个庞大的系统，其中有很多东西。

68
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:36,170
It's impossible for me to,
用一两句话将其表述清楚

69
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:38,254
like, encapsulate it into a small little summary but.
那是不可能的。

70
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:42,659
I do have this slide right here that divides it into these four layers.
我在这个课件中，将其分为四层。

71
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:46,763
These four layers are approximately down near the hardware at the bottom.
这四层从靠近硬件的底层

72
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:48,264
Up near the user at the top.
到靠近用户的顶层。

73
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:48,964
Okay?
OK？

74
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:52,284
So at the bottom, so
在最下面一层，

75
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:55,603
a lot of people don't realize that iOS is basically a Unix-based operating system.
很多人没有意识到，IOS基本就是一个基于Unix的操作系统。

76
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:57,772
'Kay? It's very similar shares a lot of
它大量借鉴了

77
00:03:57,774 --> 00:03:59,206
the core of Mac OS 10.
Mac OS 10的核心。

78
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,559
Okay?
OK？

79
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,911
Now, it's certainly optimized for mobile devices, which have
当然，它是为有电池等等各方面限制的移动设备优化过的，

80
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:08,748
battery restrictions and things like that, but that is basically what it is.
但基本上它仍可看作是一个Mac OS。

81
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,517
And so down at that layer you've got sockets, and
这样的话，在这层中包含了有关通信接口，

82
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,121
you've got you know, permissions, and things like that,
权限等等类似的功能，

83
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:19,191
that have to be near the oh you know, hardware to, to work properly.
它靠近底层硬件，并保证其正常工作。

84
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:23,495
But above that there's kind of an Object-Oriented layer that lets you get at
在这之上，是一个面向对象的层，

85
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,731
a lot of that stuff using Object-Oriented Programming.
其能够让你使用大量的面向对象编程技术。

86
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:30,234
'Kay? And this stuff is not UI oriented it's
但是这层不会处理用户界面，

87
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:34,171
more kind of accessing the hardware through Object-Oriented Programming or
其更多用于通过面向对象访问硬件，

88
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,373
accessing networking through Object-Oriented Programming but
或者访问网络，等等。

89
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,309
it's a big layer there and so we will spend a fair amount of
它是一个很大的层，我们将花大量时间

90
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:44,980
time in this layer because we need those primitives to build at the higher layers.
在该层上，因为我们需要这些原语来建立更高的层。

91
00:04:44,982 --> 00:04:48,450
Then, there's this whole layer, which I wish we had more time to spend on.
我希望我们有更多时间花在这一层，

92
00:04:48,452 --> 00:04:50,252
We only get ten weeks in this whole class.
但是我们的课程只有十周。

93
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:53,321
It goes by so fast, you'll be amazed, as you're probably,
你会感叹在斯坦福的课程中，

94
00:04:53,323 --> 00:04:54,655
used to with your Stanford courses.
时间过得如此之快。

95
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:58,092
But there's a whole media layer here, both for
再往上，是整个的媒体层，

96
00:04:58,094 --> 00:05:02,062
static images, as you know, JPEG and things like that.
包括比如你们熟悉的JPEG等的静态图像，

97
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:07,700
And video both capturing video, editing video, all that.
包括视频捕获、视频编辑等的视频处理，

98
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:11,404
Incredible audio, the frameworks on this device for
不可思议的音频框架，用于处理3D音效，

99
00:05:11,406 --> 00:05:13,706
doing 3D audio for games and all that.
以及游戏等等。

100
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,675
I get to, unfortunately I get to very little of this layer.
很不幸，我对这层知道的不多。

101
00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:20,879
But I'll try to let you know, that it's in there and then you'll know to go out and
但是我可以告诉你它里面有什么，这样你用到的时候就可以

102
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:23,948
seek out, if you're building a very audio intensive app or
查资料，或者当你正在写一个用到大量音频视频技术

103
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,484
video intensive app, you'll seek out that layer.
的应用的时候，你要知道去哪找这些资料。

104
00:05:26,486 --> 00:05:32,756
But we'll spend the vast majority of our time at the Cocoa Touch layer.
我们会在Cocoa Touch层上花费大量的时间。

105
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:35,325
So the Cocoa Touch layer, that's where the buttons and
Cocoa Touch层里包含了按钮，

106
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:38,895
sliders and things like that are it's the layer,
滑动条等类似的控件，

107
00:05:38,897 --> 00:05:43,032
where you're gonna build the interactivity with your end user.
通过它们来和你的用户建立互动。

108
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:46,135
And so, that's where we probably spend 70 plus percent of
我们会在Cocoa Touch层上

109
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,936
our time in the Cocoa Touch layer.
花费70%甚至更多的时间。

110
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:50,271
And this is a very powerful layer.
这也是一个非常强大的层。

111
00:05:50,273 --> 00:05:54,809
You know, you've seen things like the maps app on the phone.
你们可能在手机上见过地图类的应用。

112
00:05:54,811 --> 00:05:58,346
There's basically, an object that does almost the entire maps app, that you can
基本上，有一个几乎完整的地图应用对象，

113
00:05:58,348 --> 00:06:01,482
just drop right into your program, and now you have maps in your program.
你只需要直接拖进你的程序里，现在你的程序中就有地图了。

114
00:06:01,484 --> 00:06:04,051
Same thing with web browser.
同样的还有浏览器。

115
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:06,619
If you wanna put web browsing in your app, it's just boom, pop an object in there,
如果你想让你的应用有浏览网页的功能，那么仅仅需要拖拽一个对象，

116
00:06:06,622 --> 00:06:08,655
call a couple methods and in your, on your way.
再调用几个方法即可。

117
00:06:08,657 --> 00:06:13,592
So very powerful, very high level in there's a lot going on in there and
在我这里你将学到非常NB的技术。

118
00:06:13,594 --> 00:06:16,195
that's where we will spend most of our time, 'kay?
我们将在此花费大量的时间。

119
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:19,831
And by the way, if you have any questions I try to glance up, so
顺便说一嘴，如果你有任何问题，你就说嘛。

120
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,499
the bright lights over there sometimes in my way,
你不说我怎么知道呢？

121
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:25,302
but, shout out or you know, otherwise get my attention.
虽然你很有诚意的看着我，

122
00:06:25,304 --> 00:06:28,105
If you feel free to interrupt.
可是你还是要跟我说啊。

123
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:29,806
Then there's the development platform itself.
接下来就是开发平台本身。

124
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:31,308
'Kay?
OK？

125
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:32,809
With the tools we use to build these iOS apps.
我们会用这些工具来创建IOS应用。

126
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:34,978
What's in that?
那么问题来了。都有什么？

127
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,146
Well, it's all pretty much now been funneled into this one
有很多很棒的工具

128
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:39,048
application called Xcode 6.
都集成在一个名为Xcode6的应用内。

129
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,418
There are some little adjuncts that it calls out to but
其中还有一些附件。

130
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,287
Xcode 6 is everything, it's your code editor,
Xcode6，你值得拥有，它是一个代码编辑器，

131
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:50,024
it's your compiler, your debugger all of that in one, pretty awesome app.
它是一个编译器，是一个调试器，总之是一个很棒的应用。

132
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:54,395
And so we'll be learning all about Xcode 6 in this class, and
所以我们学习的所有课程都会用到Xcode6。

133
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:59,366
that's where you'll be spend all your time developing, you're not gonna be at
你所有编程的时间都在用Xcode，你不需要

134
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:04,337
a terminal typing in Emacs or something, you're gonna be in Xcode 6.
在终端下用Emacs或其他的编辑器，一切尽在Xcode6。

135
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:08,874
Languages I have there's actually, two languages in iOS now.
现在为IOS开发应用可以使用两种语言。

136
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:12,044
There are peers that you can pretty much use either one.
你可以选择使用任何一个。

137
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:14,079
One of them is called Objective-C,
其中一个名为Objective-C

138
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:17,715
that's the language that iOS was originally developed for.
它也是IOS一直以来使用的开发语言。

139
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:22,553
It's a language been around a long time, probably 30 years it's been around or 25
这个语言已经有大概30年的历史了，

140
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:27,123
to 30 years that's it's actually been used to build stuff that's on the Mac today.
25到30年以来，人们用它为Mac开发应用。

141
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:32,194
So, it's very mature language but it's also 25, 30 years old.
因此，它是非常成熟的语言，但是已经25，30岁了。

142
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:36,965
And so Apple last summer introduced a completely new language called Swift, and
所以苹果公司在去年夏天发布了一个全新的语言，Swift

143
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:40,669
Swift, you can do pretty much everything in iOS with Swift and/nSwift，你可以使用Swift在IOS上开发任何应用，

144
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:45,172
that's the language we're gonna learn because it's a modern language.
她也是本次课我们要学习的语言，她是一门现代的语言。

145
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:48,709
Apple did a great job of kind of, building all the best stuff of
苹果公司做了很多伟大的工作创建Swift，

146
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:52,346
all the languages that have been invented over the last, you know,
她吸收了很多已存在的编程语言的优点。

147
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:57,684
25 years of this especially the last five or ten years into this language.
25年来，特别是近五到十年的语言。

148
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:02,988
It's very concise it's a very type safe language but has type inference and a lot
她语法简洁。她是类型安全的，并且还有类型推断以及

149
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,991
of things that make it so that you get the best of both worlds by having type safety-
大量的特性使鱼与熊掌可以兼得。既有安全的类型

150
00:08:06,993 --> 00:08:08,292
>> [COUGH] >> And not have to
又不需要

151
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:11,295
be constantly over specifying everything.
不断的指定各种类型。

152
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:14,665
So we're gonna go Swift only, I'm not even gonna really talk about Objective-C,
所以我们只使用Swift，而完全不用Objective-C，

153
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:16,400
I just don't have time to do both languages.
我也没有时间讲两种语言

154
00:08:16,402 --> 00:08:19,786
Yeah. >> [INAUDIBLE] This is
（学生提问）

155
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:23,171
a [INAUDIBLE] course [INAUDIBLE] [COUGH] [INAUDIBLE] doing iOS development.
（学生提问）

156
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:26,275
>> Yeah, so the question is if I'm going out into the world to do
这个同学的问题是，如果我将步入社会，

157
00:08:26,277 --> 00:08:29,244
iOS development in the real world for real companies.
并想找一份做IOS开发的工作，

158
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:30,912
Am I probably, gonna have to learn Objective-C?
我是否还需要学习Objective-C？

159
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:34,049
And the answer is [NOISE] it depends on the company you're at.
答案是...这取决于你的公司。

160
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:36,017
Probably in the short term, yes.
可能在短期内，答案是肯定的。

161
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:39,920
But as the time goes by probably, more and more people switch to siff, Swift.
但是随着时间的推移，可能有越来越多的人会转到丝芙，哦不，Swift。

162
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:43,490
>> [COUGH] >> The good thing is the underlying iOS
好消息就是基础的IOS

163
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:45,926
APIs are exactly the same for both, its just the syntax-
API是完全相同的，仅仅只是语法上

164
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:49,162
>> [COUGH] >> Of the language a little bit
对于一个语言如何调用API

165
00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:52,397
about how the language approaches calling the API is slightly different, but any,会有略微的不同，但是

166
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,734
everything that you learn in here about the underlying,
你们在这里学的基础，

167
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:57,636
lying parts of iOS will totally work in Objective-C.
使用Objective-C完全也可以实现。

168
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,571
All the methods are the same you know,
所有的方法都是一样的，

169
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:00,939
it's just the syntax is a little different.
仅仅只有语法上的一点区别。

170
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,540
>> [COUGH] >> So, don't feel too bad about not
所以对于没有学全两门语言，

171
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,276
learning both languages, and once you've learned this language,
不要感到沮丧。一旦你的Swift出师了，

172
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,911
learning Objective-C is gonna be pretty easy, too.
再学Objective-C也只是分分钟的事。

173
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:10,414
So. Good question though.
这个问题问的很好。

174
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,815
All right.
很好。

175
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,617
Of course iOS is filled with tons of frameworks.
当然，IOS内部拥有成吨的框架，

176
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:18,320
Frameworks are libraries, basically, of objects that you use,
框架就是你会用到的类库以及基本对象。

177
00:09:18,322 --> 00:09:20,989
as building blocks to build your application.
作为搭建你的应用的模块，

178
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:23,325
And we are going to be covering them.
以供我们方便的使用。

179
00:09:23,327 --> 00:09:25,193
UIKit is the main one.
UIKit就是其中主要的一个。

180
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:27,829
It's got most of the user interface stuff in it.
它包含了大量的关于用户界面的东西。

181
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:32,266
Foundation is that most the course services layer that I was talking about,
Foundation将是在Core Service层中我提到最多的框架。

182
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:37,070
and but there's tons of other ones, core motion for doing the, the device moving
其他还有很多，core motion框架用于设备移动，

183
00:09:37,072 --> 00:09:42,075
around, you know, gyro and accelerometer, core data for Object-Oriented database.
旋转，陀螺及加速度等的响应，core data框架用于面向对象的数据库，

184
00:09:42,077 --> 00:09:44,961
Things like that.
等等等等...

185
00:09:44,962 --> 00:09:47,846
So I'll get to, as many as those as I can, especially the big ones.
我会尽我所能尽可能多的讲给你们，特别是那些大的框架。

186
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:50,849
But there's just way too many to cover in ten weeks.
但是这对一个只有十周的课，显得太臃肿了。

187
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:53,884
And finally we I, I put this,
然而最终的，以上的那些东西

188
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:58,188
as a first class thing with all the rest, as a design strategy MVC.
均不是我们第一课要讲的内容。我首先要说的是一个叫做MVC的设计模式。

189
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,124
I think, I usually ask, I'll all ask this year, too.
我想，我经常会问，同样今年我也要问一个问题，

190
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:05,361
How many people have used MVC in some other class?
你们有多少同学曾经在其他课上用过MVC？

191
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:07,196
See, so it's half of you.
哦，有一半的同学。

192
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:09,698
So I'll be teaching MVC, as if you don't know it, so
有同学不知道，那么我先说说MVC。

193
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,599
if you don't know it don't worry.
就算你不知道它，也不用担心。

194
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:15,636
But MVC is a way of designing your application so that it's a little more
MVC是你设计应用的一种方式，用它设计的代码

195
00:10:15,638 --> 00:10:21,141
debuggable, reusable understandable to you and to anyone reading your code.
无论是你自己或者其他人去读都更易理解，也更易调试，易复用。

196
00:10:21,143 --> 00:10:25,278
And iOS was designed with MVC from the start.
而IOS从一开始就使用MVC设计。

197
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,214
So it's just integral part to building an iOS.
而这仅仅是创建一个IOS应用整体中的一部分。

198
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:33,452
Now, I'm gonna do the demo today, and on Wednesday I'm kinda not gonna follow MVC.
现在，我要做今天的演示。而在周三我有点不想遵循MVC。

199
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:37,922
But then next Monday we're gonna apply MVC to the demo I'm doing today and
但是下周一我会应用MVC继续今天的演示，

200
00:10:37,924 --> 00:10:41,426
Wednesday, so you're gonna get the full MVC treatment there.
周三的时候你们要对MVC有充分的理解。

201
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:45,262
And I'll be having some slides on MVC on Wednesday to prepare you for next Monday.然后我将一些周三用的MVC课件准备到下周一。

202
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:49,699
Okay? All right, so here's the demo.
OK？好，下面开始演示。

203
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:51,818
The demo I'm gonna do,
接下来我要做的演示

204
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,936
is something I actually did a few years ago that really works well-
是我前几年做的，运行起来还不错。

205
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:55,971
>> [COUGH] >> With Swift, which is a calculator.
它是一个计算器，我们用Swift实现它。

206
00:10:55,973 --> 00:10:57,373
So, we're gonna build this calculator.
现在，我们来创建这个计算器。

207
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,509
And we're gonna build it from scratch, all the way.
我们将从头开始，一步一步创建它。

208
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:04,545
And I like to do my demos, where I only type in stuff, I don't copy and
我喜欢动手敲代码来做演示，而不会复制

209
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:06,914
paste big chunks of code in or whatever.
粘贴大段代码或者什么的。

210
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,817
I know, I'd see a lot of laptops open, a lot of people like to try and
我知道，我看到很多人都打开了笔记本，很多人都喜欢

211
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:12,736
follow along with me.
跟着我亲自动手尝试。

212
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:15,654
I'm a fast typer, but usually in most demos you can keep, keep up if you want.
我打字速度很快，但是通常在大多数演示中，你还是能够跟上我的速度，只要你想。

213
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:20,426
I don't recommend it necessarily, or certainly I don't require it.
我并不推荐这么做，或者说不必要这样。

214
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:25,197
I am going to, you, you'll be able to go back and
我想你，你可以回去

215
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:28,400
watch this particular demo on video.
看一遍这个演示视频。

216
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:30,535
Even Stanford people will be able to do that.
即使斯坦福的学生可以这么做，

217
00:11:30,537 --> 00:11:34,805
Because your first assignment is gonna be to reproduce what I do.
因为你的首要任务是要重现我所做的。

218
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:37,041
'Kay? That is 90% of your first assignment.
OK?这就是你第一份任务的90%

219
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:40,277
Reproduce what I'm gonna do, today and on Wednesday.
重现我要做的，今天和星期三。

220
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,946
So I'm not gonna post the code because I want you to go through the experience of
我不会将代码给你，因为我要你通过这个体验

221
00:11:42,948 --> 00:11:45,615
typing the code in, and if you watch in on video,
自己动手敲代码，即时你是在看这个视频，

222
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:50,119
watching what I do again, and and typing it all in.
再看一遍我干了什么，然后自己敲代码。

223
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:51,219
>> [COUGH] 'Kay?
OK？

224
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:52,821
And I'll explain that all on Wednesday.
我将在周三对所有问题做解释。

225
00:11:54,457 --> 00:11:56,340
Okay?
OK？

226
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,224
So, I put on the slide a bunch of things that I'm gonna cover, but I'm not gonna go
我要把课件盖住了。但是我不会

227
00:11:58,227 --> 00:12:01,628
over it in advance, I'm just gonna sit, sit and soon I'll start doing it.
向前翻，我要坐下，然后开始演示。

228
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,498
So any questions before I dive in here?
在这之前还有什么问题吗？

229
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,401
I know we're gonna little fast, but I wanna maximize your learning time.
我知道我讲的有点快，因为我想最大化你们的学习时间。

230
00:12:08,403 --> 00:12:11,870
[INAUDIBLE] [NOISE].
（同学提问）

231
00:12:11,872 --> 00:12:12,771
Direct of what?
什么玩意？

232
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,706
Recommendation to which Xcode-
（同学提问）

233
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:18,142
So the questions, which Xcode should we use, should you use?
那么问题来了，我们应该用哪个版本的Xcode？你用的是哪个版本？

234
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:20,811
Well, you should just use the one on the Mac App store.
你们用Mac App Store上下载的就好了。

235
00:12:20,813 --> 00:12:23,247
So, just go to the Mac App store, it's free.
去Mac App Store上免费下载。

236
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:25,482
Use the one there, whatever the latest one is.
那里的是最新的版本。

237
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:28,618
If a new one comes out in the quarter, well, let's all switch over to it.
如果有更新的版本出来，那么我们就换成那个。

238
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,620
Okay, let's just always be using the latest Xcode.
总之我们用的是最新版本的Xcode。

239
00:12:30,622 --> 00:12:31,354
'Kay any-
OK，还有问题吗？

240
00:12:31,356 --> 00:12:32,621
[INAUDIBLE] Beta [INAUDIBLE] No.
（同学提问）[应该是问是否要用测试版]

241
00:12:32,623 --> 00:12:33,855
Not. We're not gonna using a beta or
不，我们不用测试版

242
00:12:33,857 --> 00:12:35,624
anything like that.
或者类似的一些版本。

243
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,392
We'll just use whatever the currently published Xcode is.
我们只用当前最新的Xcode的发布版本。

244
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:41,746
Okay.
OK

245
00:12:41,747 --> 00:12:44,498
So, I'm going to start this demo actually by launching Xcode.
那么我要开始运行Xcode来演示了。

246
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,265
So, here it is, right here.
额，这，在这。

247
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:50,669
Xcode.

248
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,270
And when you launch Xcode, let's hide others here.
运行Xcode以后，我们把其他东西隐藏起来。

249
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,140
You're gonna get this splash screen and
你会看到这个欢迎界面

250
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:58,376
on this splash screen on the right, this is gonna be all your projects.
在欢迎界面的右边，将展示你所有的项目。

251
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,711
Now, since it's the beginning of the quarter, we don't have any projects yet,
现在，这学期刚刚开始，我们还没有任何的项目。

252
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,048
but they'll all be listed here, so as the quarter goes by this will fill up.
但是慢慢的，我们会逐渐将这个列表填满。

253
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,284
You can turn this splash screen off, if you don't like it by the way.
如果你不喜欢这个欢迎页面，可以将它关闭。

254
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,820
This splash screen also lets us do things like playgrounds and
欢迎界面中也可以创建例如playground，

255
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:13,256
a source code management right down here.
或者源代码管理，像这里。

256
00:13:13,258 --> 00:13:15,024
We're not gonna be doing that for a while.
我们不会这么做很久，

257
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:16,859
We're gonna be focusing on this option, right here.
我们需要关注的是这个选项，这里。

258
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:18,760
Create a new Xcode project.
创建新的Xcode项目。

259
00:13:18,762 --> 00:13:22,463
If you don't have the splash screen, you can go to File > New > Project.
如果你看不到欢迎界面，你也可以用菜单文件>新建>项目

260
00:13:22,465 --> 00:13:23,748
Kay.
OK

261
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:25,032
Same thing, those both the same thing.
一样的，它们都是一样的。

262
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:28,469
So I'm gonna click right here on Create a new project.
下面我点击这里，创建一个新项目。

263
00:13:28,471 --> 00:13:31,605
When I create a new project, it wants to know what kind of project you want to
当我创建新项目的时候，她要知道你要创建的是什么类型的项目。

264
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:35,908
create, because Xcode is actually used on Mac OS 10 and to build frameworks and
创建，Xcode用于在Mac OS 10上创建框架，

265
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,494
all that stuff.
以及所有东西。

266
00:13:38,495 --> 00:13:41,079
But we're always gonna be building iOS Applications.
但是我们经常创建的是IOS，应用。

267
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:43,382
And in fact, we're always gonna use this template right here,
事实上，我们经常用到的模板是在这里，

268
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:44,783
Single View Application.
单页面（视图）应用。

269
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:47,236
'Kay?
OK？

270
00:13:47,237 --> 00:13:49,688
That's kind of your basic MVC starter application and
这就是你的基础MVC入门应用。

271
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,724
we're gonna build very complicated apps out of that, but we're gonna start here,
我们会用其他这些创建非常复杂的应用，但是我们从这里开始。

272
00:13:53,726 --> 00:13:55,592
so you always click on that one.
所以你会经常点这个。

273
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:58,528
Then it wants to know what you want to call your app, and
然后它想知道你会如何称呼你的应用。

274
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,598
we're building a calculator, so we're gonna call our app, Calculator.
我们正在创建的是计算器，所以我们给我们的应用起名为，Calculator。

275
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,634
'Kay?
OK？

276
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,669
This organization name doesn't really matter that's just gonna appear in
这个组织名称并不重要，它只会出现在

277
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:10,339
copyright notice and the code that you write at the top in a comment so
类似版权信息，或者你的代码开头的注释中，所以

278
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:12,291
don't worry about that.
不用管它。

279
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:14,242
But this organization identifier that is very important.
但是这里的组织标识符是非常重要的。

280
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:17,611
'Kay, this uniquely identifies you.
它是你的唯一标识符。

281
00:14:17,613 --> 00:14:19,230
Okay?
OK？

282
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:20,848
So that on the next line we can you just,
所以在下一行里我们，你会

283
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,950
new uniquely idefy, identify your calculator.
有一个新的唯一的标识符，标识你的计算器。

284
00:14:23,952 --> 00:14:26,219
So here if your a Stanford student,
所以如果你是斯坦福的学生，

285
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:31,490
you'll wanna use this reverse DNS notation here edu.stanford.cs1983p.
你要使用这个反转的DNS域名，edu.stanford.cs1983p。

286
00:14:31,492 --> 00:14:35,093
And instead of instructor there, you wanna put your SU net ID.
并用你的SU网络ID将instructor替换

287
00:14:35,095 --> 00:14:36,661
'Kay?
OK？

288
00:14:36,663 --> 00:14:37,929
Cuz nobody else has that but you.
[因为：Nobody Nobody But You]
Sorry，因为那东西只有你才有

289
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:39,864
And that'll uniquely identify you.
这样这个标识符就是唯一的了。

290
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,201
As I said, we're using Swift not Objective-C.
我说过，我们要用Swift而不是Objective-C。

291
00:14:44,203 --> 00:14:49,272
And we're gonna build an app that works be, equally well on iPad and
我们要创建的应用要能同时工作在iPad和

292
00:14:49,274 --> 00:14:51,507
iPhone, that's called a universal app.
iPhone上，所以选择Universal应用。

293
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:54,209
You can pick to develop for only one or the other.
你也可以选择只为其中一种设备开发。

294
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:56,745
But we are going to go universal here.
但是我们现在创建的是通用的。

295
00:14:56,747 --> 00:15:00,248
We're not gonna really be doing the iPad part of it for a couple weeks.
在这几周之内我们不会真的做它的iPad部分。

296
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,352
But it is our intent to eventually build an app that works on both.
但是它最终会创建一个通用的应用[同时运行在iPad和iPhone上]。

297
00:15:04,354 --> 00:15:06,186
Okay we're not going to be using core data,
额，我们现在还用不到core data。

298
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:09,322
that's object oriented database stuff so you just leave that unchecked.
那是关于面向对象数据库的东西，现在先不要选它。

299
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:13,993
And now it's asking where we want to save it, I strongly recommend saving in your
现在，它问我们要把项目保存在哪里，我强烈建议保存在你的

300
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:18,998
home directory, this is my home directory here in a folder called Developer, okay?
home目录下，这是我的home目录，里面有一个Developer的目录，看到没？

301
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,001
You could put other folders in here if you want to arrange it more,
当然你也可以在这里放其它文件夹，如果你想创建更多的话

302
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:25,103
but home directory Developer, I highly recommend that.
不过我建议你放在主目录下的Developer文件夹

303
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:28,273
Source control, we will be talking about that at some point in the quarter but
Source control,我们将会在这学期的某些时候讲到，不过

304
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:30,141
we're not gonna do it right off the bat here so
我们先跳过这个

305
00:15:30,143 --> 00:15:31,776
you can leave that unchecked as well.
所以那个选项你可以不打勾

306
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:37,847
All right, so here's our first project, its been created so
好啦，这就是我们创建的第一个项目

307
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:43,586
this is Xcode that your seeing right here, this is Xcode's main screen and
这里你看到的就是XCode, 这是XCode的主窗口

308
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:46,955
the center is really what your working on.
中间这部分是主要的工作区域

309
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:51,026
The left is, area here, is called the navigator, and the navigator you,
左边的区域，被称作navigator（导航栏）

310
00:15:51,028 --> 00:15:54,829
you use to kind of choose what you're working on but you can also do
通常用来选择特定的选项，不过也你可以用来

311
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:59,367
things over here like search hough your whole project, that's this little guy.
搜索整个项目的东西，这就是这个小图标的作用

312
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:04,838
Look at all your break points maybe, look at previous builds that you've done,
这里用来查看断点，这里用来查看之前编译的项目

313
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,076
browse your project by class hierarchy, all that stuff.
这里可以以类的层次结构展开整个项目，等等

314
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:12,312
But we're usually on the left most one here which is just all of the files in 
不过我们通常会点击左边的区域，这里可以看到我们所有的文件

315
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:17,750
your project which can also can be organized hierarchically like this.
像这样，你的项目可以有按层次展现出来

316
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:19,585
And when you select something here on the left,
当你选择左边区域这里的某些部分，

317
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:23,588
the middle will fill up with what that you've selected so.
中间区域会出现你刚刚选择的那部分内容

318
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,591
Here I have the actual project itself selected.
这里我选择了这个项目本身

319
00:16:26,593 --> 00:16:28,993
So these are the project settings of which there are tons.
所以这里可以看到这个项目的很多设置项

320
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:31,662
All along the top here you can see tons of settings.
在这上面你还可以看到更多设置项

321
00:16:31,664 --> 00:16:34,431
We're, we'll go through them as the quarter goes on and
随着学期进展我们将会讲到这些

322
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:37,100
you've already seen some of them like the bundle identifier there and
你已经看到其中的一部分，比如这里的Bundle identifier(包标识符)

323
00:16:37,102 --> 00:16:38,702
the fact this is a universal app.
还可以看到这里是一个通用app

324
00:16:38,704 --> 00:16:41,037
We're not going to talk about anymore of this today,
不过我们今天不会讲关于项目设置

325
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,805
this project settings business.
的更多内容

326
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:45,107
We're gonna focus here on some of these files.
我们会把注意力集中在这些文件

327
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:47,409
And even some of these files, like this AppDelegate,
甚至是这些文件，比如AppDelegate

328
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:50,845
I'm just gonna move that down to Supporting Files to get it out of the way.
我会把它们移到Supporting Files

329
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:53,081
Same things with these image assets,
image assets文件夹也是

330
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:56,117
LaunchScreen well get to this later in the quarter.
LaunchScreen我们之后会讲到

331
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:58,285
But I wanna focus on these two files right here.
不过我们现在会把注意力集中在这两个文件上

332
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:03,957
Okay Main.storyboard and ViewController.swift, okay
Main.storyboard 和ViewController.swift

333
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,192
In the MVC world by the way, this is the V,
顺便说，在MVC中这称为V

334
00:17:06,194 --> 00:17:10,896
the view and this is the C, the controller but we will talk about MVC on Wednesday.
即视图，这是C，即控制器，我们将在周三讲到MVC

335
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:13,665
So what do these things contain?
所以这些东西包含什么

336
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:16,234
So this Main.storyboard, if I click on it,
这是Main.storyboard，如果我点击它

337
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,936
you see it appear in the middle, this is our UI.
可以看到我们的UI出现在中间

338
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,972
Okay, this is our user interface.
恩，这就是我们的用户界面

339
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:23,973
So for a calculator this is going to be a little display,
对于计算器而言，这里将会是一个稍微小一点的显示区域

340
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,811
this shows the number that we're working on or whatever at the top.
这里会显示我们计算出来的数字或任何其它在上面的数字

341
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:32,448
And lots of buttons down here, number buttons, times, multi, or sorry, times,
下面这里会有很多按钮，包括数字，乘除

342
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,917
divide, plus, minus, square root.
加减，平方根

343
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:36,451
That's all going to be here.
都会出现在这里

344
00:17:36,453 --> 00:17:39,521
So we're going to build this entire user interface.
所以我们即将完全图形化地搭建整个用户界面

345
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:41,055
Purely graphically.


346
00:17:41,057 --> 00:17:43,057
Okay? We're not gonna be writing code.
明白不，我们不会写代码

347
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:45,259
Put button at this location.
来指出哪个按钮该放哪个位置

348
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:47,411
None of that, okay?
一点代码都没有，懂不？

349
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:49,562
We just literally with our mouse are gonna build this whole user interface.
我们只是用我们的鼠标来搭建我们的用户界面

350
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:53,700
So what's the code, what do we need any code for?
所以我们的代码写在哪里，什么时候需要写代码？

351
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:57,203
Well, we, this ViewController.swift, this is a Swift file.
看ViewController.swif，这个Swift文件

352
00:17:57,205 --> 00:18:00,539
This is your first look at Swift for most of you.
这是你们第一次看Swift文件

353
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,108
This controller is gonna control that user interface.
这是我们的控制器，用来控制我们的用户界面

354
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,877
That's why we call it the view controller or the controller.
这就是为什么我们称之为视图控制器或控制器

355
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:09,180
It controls user interface and that means it's gonna do things that
它控制用户界面，这意味着它会做某些事情来

356
00:18:09,182 --> 00:18:13,651
are specific to how this user interface, a calculator's user interface, works.
指定这个用户界面，计算器界面应该怎样工作

357
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:16,720
So when we press the digit buttons, it's going to have update the display.
所以当你点击数字按钮，它会更新显示的内容

358
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:19,856
When we press times, it's gonna have to do some multiplication and
当我们点击乘法，它将会进行乘法运算并且

359
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:21,524
then put the result in the display.
把结果显示出来

360
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:24,227
So it's controlling the display.
所以说它会控制界面的展示

361
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:28,597
Okay so we'll get back to this code in a moment but we're gonna start by
我们稍后再回到这里，现在我们先从

362
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:33,802
building our user interface and by the way, your user interface, you can see I
搭建界面开始，顺便说一句，你可以看到这个用户界面

363
00:18:33,804 --> 00:18:39,140
have a low resolution screen here so my UI doesn't even really fit in the space here.
因为屏幕的低分辨率，所以我的UI没有很好地适应空间

364
00:18:39,142 --> 00:18:42,677
You'll probably have maybe a little higher resolution screen then I do but
你可能有比我更高的屏幕分辨率，不过

365
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:45,979
if you don't, you can zoom in and out, I'm just right-clicking,
如果你没有，你可以通过点击右键放大缩小

366
00:18:45,981 --> 00:18:49,516
if you right-click on the background area here, you can zoom in and out.
如果你在这个背景区域点击右键，你可以放大缩小

367
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:52,652
You can also do it by double-clicking so if I double-click on this,
你也可以采用双击，看如果我双击这里

368
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:56,122
it zooms it to normal, if I double-click on the background, it zooms out so
它放大到正常水平，如果我再双击背景，它会缩小所以

369
00:18:56,124 --> 00:18:57,523
that way I can see my whole UI.
我可以看到我的整个UI界面

370
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:59,992
Now when we build a complicated app
当我们完成了一个复杂的app

371
00:18:59,994 --> 00:19:05,663
we're gonna have a whole bunch of these little square areas, we call these scenes,
我们将会有一大堆这些方块区域，这些我们称之为scenes(场景)

372
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:11,402
and a scene represents kind of phone full, phone screen full of information.
一个场景代表一个完整显示所有信息的手机屏幕

373
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:15,072
Okay and as you you've used many iOS applications, you know that you
就像你使用过的许多iOS程序，你知道

374
00:19:15,074 --> 00:19:20,443
transition from one screen to another as the user goes through the app and
用户使用这个app通过一个屏幕切换到另外一个屏幕

375
00:19:20,445 --> 00:19:22,111
that's how your gonna build your apps as well.
这就是你搭建app的方式

376
00:19:22,113 --> 00:19:25,981
And this storyboard is eventually gonna have a big map showing all
这个storyboard（故事版）最终将会有一个大的地图来显示所有的

377
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:28,951
the transitions between all those scenes.
场景间的切换

378
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:31,019
Okay, so this storyboard is gonna get big for
好了，所以这个storyboard将会用来搭建

379
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:35,323
big apps, your really gonna see your whole application which is kinda cool.
完整的app，所以当你真的看到整个应用程序时，还挺酷的

380
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,893
So we're gonna start small though, just this one little screen right here.
所以我们将从这一个小的场景开始

381
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:41,361
Which is gonna be our calculator.
搭建我们的计算器

382
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:44,864
So let's start building our calculator with it's display.
我们先从搭建计算器的界面显示开始

383
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:45,999
So I wanna make a display.
所以，当我想显示一些东西时，

384
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:47,917
So how do I do that?
我应该这样做？

385
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:49,834
Well that brings us to the right side, the right-hand side here,
我们看一下这里的右边区域

386
00:19:49,837 --> 00:19:53,939
this whole right side, this is called the Utilities area
右边的整块区域，我们称为工具区域

387
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:56,675
You can see that's it's got a bottom and a top, right?
你可以看到这里有底部和顶部，对不？

388
00:19:56,677 --> 00:20:01,979
We want to go into the bottom and on the third tab right here, which is called
来到底部这里的第三个按钮，它被我们称为

389
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:07,818
the Object Library, you'll see that there's tons and tons of objects in here.
对象库，你可你看到这里有非常多的对象

390
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,886
Okay, dozens of these things and
非常多的这类东西

391
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:13,023
we're gonna get to a lot of these by the end of the quarter.
我们在学期末将会接触到很多这样的东西

392
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:15,992
But these are the things you build your user interface out of.
这些是用于搭建你的用户界面的

393
00:20:15,994 --> 00:20:19,362
So kind of towards the top, not all the way at the top, but towards the top,
靠近上面，但不完全靠近上面，就在这上面

394
00:20:19,364 --> 00:20:22,731
you'll start seeing things like buttons and text fields and things like that.
你会开始看到像按钮，文本区域这样的东西

395
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:26,401
Well this is what we need obviously, to build our display here,
很明显这是我们构建显示区域所需要的东西

396
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:28,536
is some sort of text field, and there's a couple of them here.
是某种显示文本的区域，这里有两种

397
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:32,140
One, this one called Label is static text, you see?
这一种称为Label的是一种固定的文本，看到不？

398
00:20:32,142 --> 00:20:37,011
And this one Text Field is editable text, in other words you can touch on this one.
这种称为Text Field是一张可编辑的文本，也就是说，你当你按下时

399
00:20:37,013 --> 00:20:39,846
And the little keyboard would slide up from the bottom and you could type in it.
键盘会从底部滑出来，所以你可以输入文本

400
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:42,882
So, the calculator, you can't really touch on the screen and
因此对于计算器来说，你确实不能按下屏幕并且

401
00:20:42,884 --> 00:20:45,018
start typing so we want this static text.
输入，所以我们需要固定的文本

402
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,721
So, I'm just going to pick this up with the mouse and drag it out.
所以我用我的鼠标把它拖出来

403
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:50,990
Now, when I drag it out into my UI,
现在，当我把它拖入我的UI中时

404
00:20:50,991 --> 00:20:53,258
you're going to see a lot of little blue dash lines appearing.
你会看到很多蓝色虚线出现，

405
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,227
You see these?
看到没

406
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:57,195
These are helping me put this in the right place.
这些可以帮助我们正确地摆放这些东西

407
00:20:57,197 --> 00:21:00,798
So, I can put it right in the center, for example, of my view.
所以，比如说我可以把它放在视图的中间

408
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:04,335
I could put it up in a corner up here, which is what I'm gonna do.
我可以把它放在靠顶部这里，我待会就准备这样做

409
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:05,669
Mm-kay.


410
00:21:05,671 --> 00:21:10,073
You always want your things that you put in your UI,
你总是会希望你放入UI中的东西

411
00:21:10,075 --> 00:21:14,643
as much as humanly possible, to be on one of these dashed blue lines.
尽可能地去利用这些蓝色虚线

412
00:21:14,645 --> 00:21:16,445
And you'll understand why in a couple weeks when we
你会明白为什么几周之后当我们

413
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:18,097
starting talking about auto-layout.
开始关于auto-layou（自动布局）的课程

414
00:21:18,098 --> 00:21:19,748
I'm gonna do a little auto-layout right here just to kind of
我这里将会涉及一点关于auto-layou的东西，可以让你

415
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,351
give you a feel for it.
它有点感觉

416
00:21:22,352 --> 00:21:24,953
But those blue, dashed blue lines are gonna be your best friend when it comes to
不过，在你搭建用户界面的时候，这些蓝色虚线将会是你最好的朋友

417
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:28,322
building your user interface and you'll quickly see why that is.
你会很快知道为什么了

418
00:21:28,324 --> 00:21:30,691
Once you drag something out like this, you can,
每次你像这样拖动东西，你可以

419
00:21:30,693 --> 00:21:34,061
these little things are rounded that show it's selected, right?
看到环绕在外面的东西，它表明了这个被选中了

420
00:21:34,063 --> 00:21:38,465
They also are little resize handles so you can grab them and resize them when you
它们也可以用于调整大小，所以可以抓住它然后或者重新调整它们的大小

421
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:42,235
resize it also re-puts those dashed blue lines out there, okay?
当你调整大小时，这些蓝色虚线会重新排成一列，看到没

422
00:21:42,237 --> 00:21:43,969
So you definitely wanna, even have,
所以当你调整大小时，你肯定想

423
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:47,106
when you're resizing, get those things lining up.
把这些东西排成一列

424
00:21:47,108 --> 00:21:50,976
You can also manipulate it directly, just double-click on it, like a calculator
你还可以操作这些东西，只需要双击一下

425
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:54,145
probably doesn't want to come up, this is gonna be initial state of this.
通常计算器的初始状态不是这样子

426
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:58,349
Doesn't want to come up saying Label, it probably wants 0 or
初始状态上面不会显示Label，它可能会显示0

427
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:01,318
something like that in it's display.
或类似的东西

428
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,354
There's also things you wanna set about this though or
还有另外一张方式，当你无法正确地设置这种

429
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:08,258
anything you drag in your UI that you just can't direct manipulate and
拖入你UI的任何东西时

430
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,261
that's what the top half of this Utilities windows is, is for, okay?
你可以使用靠上的Utilities windows（工具窗口）

431
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:13,829
So if you look at the top half here,
所以当你看上面这里

432
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:17,065
there's a bunch of tabs across the top including something like this,
在顶部这里有许多标签，包括像这种

433
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:20,035
the Size Inspector for setting the size of this thing.
用于设置尺寸的Size Inspector（尺寸调节器）

434
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:24,305
And this tab right here, really important, this is the Attributes Inspector.
还有这里的这个标签，称作Attributes Inspector（属性检查器），非常重要

435
00:22:24,307 --> 00:22:27,908
And this is an object oriented inspector, depending on what you have selected.
这是一个面向对象的检查器，当你选择不同的东西时

436
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,611
You'll have different user interface here in the top.
用户界面将会有所改变

437
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:33,880
And this let's you edit attributes about what's selected.
这个可以让你编辑你选中的东西的属性

438
00:22:33,882 --> 00:22:35,882
So, for example,
比如

439
00:22:35,883 --> 00:22:37,883
a calculator, the zero doesn't really want to be on the left, right?
计算器中这个0其实不是在左边，对不

440
00:22:37,886 --> 00:22:40,653
Calculators, the zero, the numbers are on the right and
这个0应该是在右边

441
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:43,589
they kind of grow out from the right.
这些数字就像是从右边出现的

442
00:22:43,591 --> 00:22:47,426
And so we can easily fix that with this alignment thing right here.
所以我们可以很轻松地使用这里的alignment（校准）修改它

443
00:22:47,428 --> 00:22:50,595
So I'm gonna click this and you see the zero move over to the right.
我点击这里所以你可以看到0移动到右边

444
00:22:50,597 --> 00:22:52,130
And, and maybe I want a bigger font.
还有，也许我想要大点的字体

445
00:22:52,132 --> 00:22:53,231
You see the font right here.
你可以看到这里的font（字体）

446
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:55,666
I can click on this, pick different fonts.
我可以点击这里，选择不同的字体

447
00:22:55,668 --> 00:22:59,470
I'm gonna just move it up to like 32 point, it's a nice big font.
把它增大到32点，稍微大点的字体

448
00:22:59,472 --> 00:23:00,937
You can notice it kinda cuts off.
你可以看到字体有点被截小了

449
00:23:00,939 --> 00:23:02,572
I made it so big that it's too small.
字体放大因此这里显得太小

450
00:23:02,574 --> 00:23:06,976
So I can always just resize this larger to make that fit. 
所以我可以重新调整大小使之适应字体的大小

451
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:10,345
So this is how we build our user interface.
这就是我们搭建用户界面的方式

452
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:14,949
It's very direct manipulation and very object oriented as you'll start to
非常直观的操作，并且非常地面向对象

453
00:23:14,951 --> 00:23:17,451
see when we add different kinds of objects.
当你加入不同的对象时你就可以看到

454
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:20,187
So, let's actually run this application, okay?
所以，让我们真正地运行我们的应用

455
00:23:20,189 --> 00:23:22,956
We haven't done, built any calculaterness about it, but
我们还没有完成，任何关于计算的东西

456
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:25,992
we have this one field, let's run it and see what it looks like.
不过让我们运行一下看看是上面效果

457
00:23:25,994 --> 00:23:27,226
So, how do you run things?
所以，应该如何运行？

458
00:23:27,228 --> 00:23:29,562
Well, you see right here where it says, iPhone 6?
嗯，这里你可以看到，iPhone 6？

459
00:23:29,564 --> 00:23:33,331
This actually is a selector that lets you say where you want to
这实际上是可以让你选择在哪里

460
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,166
run your application.
运行你的应用

461
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,636
So you can see you can run it on an iOS device if you have one connected,
所以你有一个iOS设备连接上时，你可以运行在iOS设备上

462
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:40,271
I don't have one connected
currently.
现在我还没有连接的设备

463
00:23:41,273 --> 00:23:43,056
But you can do that.
不过你可以选择那个选项

464
00:23:43,057 --> 00:23:44,840
And we'll talk in a Friday section probably in a week or
我们将会在一到两周后的周五

465
00:23:44,843 --> 00:23:48,478
two about how to get your devices hooked up.
谈论如何连接你的设备

466
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,948
But also there's these plethora of simulators here, iPhone 6,
不过这里有很多模拟器iPhone 6

467
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,552
6+, iPhone 5, iPhone 4s, iPad Airs.
6+, iPhone 5, iPhone 4s, iPad Airs

468
00:23:56,554 --> 00:23:58,920
And you can pick one of these to run on and
你可以选择其中的一个运行

469
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:02,490
it'll actually simulate that device right here on your computer.
它实际上是在你的电脑上模拟那些设备

470
00:24:02,492 --> 00:24:05,827
So I'm gonna run on the iPhone 6.
所以我将会运行在iPhone 6

471
00:24:05,829 --> 00:24:08,729
Okay,I'm just gonna hit Play, see this Play button right here?
好了，我将要点击Play按钮，看到Play按钮没

472
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:11,498
That's how you simulate, so Play.
这就是使用模拟器的方式，所以点击Play

473
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,933
Now it's launching the simulator.
现在启动模拟器

474
00:24:12,935 --> 00:24:14,601
It's a separate process.
它是一个独立的处理进程

475
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:16,169
And it's going to run our app in there.
将会在这里运行我们的app

476
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:17,403
And there it is.
情况就是这样

477
00:24:17,405 --> 00:24:18,737
Now you might say, whoop.
现在你可能会说，哇

478
00:24:18,739 --> 00:24:19,905
Big white square.
这么大的白色正方形

479
00:24:19,907 --> 00:24:21,339
Oh that's not so good.
看起来不怎么好

480
00:24:21,341 --> 00:24:23,825
And the reason this is so
这是因为

481
00:24:23,826 --> 00:24:26,310
big is because the iPhone 6 has a very high resolution display on it.
iPhone 6的高分辨率屏幕

482
00:24:26,312 --> 00:24:30,881
Okay, the retina display, and it's way higher resolution than my computer, okay?
视网膜屏幕，比我电脑上的分辨率大得多

483
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:35,151
So I actually have to scroll around, you see there's the top of it.
所以我实际上不得不进行滑动，你可以看到它的顶部

484
00:24:35,153 --> 00:24:37,754
Scroll up and down to get to i all.
通过上下滑动可以看到整个区域

485
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:42,558
Luckily if you go to Window, this is not in the simulator now, the iOS simulator.
幸运的是如果我们前往Window选项，这个选项现在不在iOS模拟器

486
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,628
If you go to Window and Scale, you can scale it down to be smaller and
如果你点击Window并且点击Scale，你可以把它缩得更小

487
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,762
then it'll fit.
使之适用屏幕

488
00:24:47,764 --> 00:24:49,497
Okay, so if you have a low resolution screen,
因此，如果你有低分辨率的屏幕

489
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:51,532
you're definitely gonna wanna use Window > Scale.
你肯定会点击Window > Scale

490
00:24:51,534 --> 00:24:54,368
Cmd+3 right there is another way to do it.
快捷键Cmd+3是另外一种方式

491
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:57,654
Okay?
懂不

492
00:24:57,655 --> 00:25:00,939
So here's our UI, but it doesn't look to good, okay, because where's this?
所以，这就是我们的UI，不过看起来不怎么样，因为这个在哪？

493
00:25:00,942 --> 00:25:05,011
We put this zero in there and it just never showed up, what did we do wrong?
我们把0放在这里然后它从来都没有出现，我们哪里做错了？

494
00:25:05,013 --> 00:25:08,781
Well we didn't really do anything wrong and that zero is actually there.
实际上我们没有做错，那个0实际上就在那里

495
00:25:08,783 --> 00:25:11,750
It's just, here let me line up these UI's, this is not
它只是，先让我把UI排成一列，虽然没有

496
00:25:11,752 --> 00:25:16,554
necessarily exactly the same scale but its appropriate, approximately the same scale,
必要完全相同的缩放尺寸，不过刚好是同样的尺寸

497
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:19,857
you can see that the zero is actually off screen, [NOISE] okay?
你可以看到那个0实际上在屏幕外面，看到不？

498
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:24,028
So its there but you just can't see it because its over here off the screen.
所以实际上它存在只不过你没有看到它，因为它在屏幕外面

499
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:28,465
Okay, and that's a problem, but that's a problem we can fix.
这是一个问题，不过这个问题我们可以解决

500
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:29,732
So let's go fix that problem.
所以我们开始解决这个问题

501
00:25:31,302 --> 00:25:32,534
Why is that thing off-screen?
为什么它在屏幕外面？

502
00:25:32,536 --> 00:25:35,837
Well, look at this UI right here, okay?
好了，看到这个UI没

503
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,838
What shape is it?
它是什么形状的？

504
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,373
It's square.
它是正方形的

505
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,908
Okay, no IOS device is square.
不过没有任何iOS设备是正方形的

506
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,544
There's not a single square iOS device in the world.
世界上没有任何一种正方形的iOS设备

507
00:25:43,546 --> 00:25:45,078
They're all, you know, tall and
你知道的，它们都是高的，并且

508
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,581
thin, or, if you turn them sideways, then they're long and short.
瘦的，或者如果把它们侧身来看，它们都又长又短

509
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,650
Or even like an iPad.
甚至像一个iPad

510
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:52,718
You know the aspect ratio on an iPad is slightly different than an iPhone so
你知道iPad的纵横比和iPhone稍微有点不同

511
00:25:52,721 --> 00:25:55,588
their all slightly different, but none of\ them are square.
它们略有不同，但他们都不是正方形的

512
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,657
So why do we design our UI in a square?
所以为什么我们把我们的UI设计为方的？

513
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:03,762
Because the way you design iOS interfaces, you design them in this square and
因为你设计iOS界面的方式是你把它们设计在这个方形中并且

514
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:09,033
you give everything inside the square rules, called constraints,
你给所有东西添加这些规则，这些规则我们称之为约束

515
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:12,236
about what happens to them when they get squished down.
是关于当它们被压扁时应该发生什么事情

516
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:15,505
Either squished down vertically, squished down horizontally,
不过是水平还是垂直的压扁

517
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,508
depending on what kinda device their getting put on, okay?
取决于它们被放到哪种设备中，明白不

518
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,912
So you put these rules in there, so, what does it look like to put these rules in?
所以你会在加入这些规则，所以当加入这样规则后看起来会怎样？

519
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:26,115
Well again, it's all direct manipulation, so
同样的，这些都是直观的操作

520
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:31,186
I'm going to give some rules to this label right here to make it so that it knows
我将要对这里的这个标签增加一些规则，使得它知道

521
00:26:31,188 --> 00:26:36,957
what to do when this square gets squished down in any direction for any device.
对于任何方向的任何设备被压扁时应该如何显示

522
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:38,659
So, what do I want the rules to be?
所以，我希望这些规则是什么样的？

523
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:42,162
Well, I always want this thing to use the whole width.
我总希望它可以使用全部的宽度

524
00:26:42,164 --> 00:26:44,931
However much width I have, I want it all.
不管我的宽度是多少，我都希望填满这个宽度

525
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:50,102
So I'm gonna pin this right edge to this edge, okay?
所以我要固定这个右边缘到这个边缘的距离，ok？

526
00:26:50,104 --> 00:26:53,205
I'm gonna make it so all widths are pinned to each other.
我这样做是因为所有宽度都会由另外一方决定

527
00:26:53,207 --> 00:26:55,007
And I do that with the Ctrl key.
我使用Ctrl键来完成

528
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:57,559
I've turned on sticky keys so
我已经开启粘滞键所以

529
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,110
you can see down in the lower left here, it's showing the modifier keys I'm using.
在左下角你可以看到，它显示了我正使用的修饰键

530
00:27:00,113 --> 00:27:02,213
So right now I'm holding down Ctrl.
所以现在我按住Ctrl

531
00:27:02,215 --> 00:27:08,485
And I'm gonna Ctrl+drag from the right edge of this to the container it's in.
我会按Ctrl 从右边拖动到它的容器的右边

532
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:11,822
See how it's showing me what I'm dragged to.
看它是如何展示我正在拖动的过程

533
00:27:11,824 --> 00:27:15,125
So when I drag to this container, it puts a menu up and says,
所以，当我拖到这个容器时，它会出现菜单并且提示我

534
00:27:15,127 --> 00:27:20,830
oh, okay, you want some rule between that label's right edge and
好吧，你想在标签和右边缘之间增加一些规则

535
00:27:20,832 --> 00:27:23,999
this thing's edge, what do you want it to be?
这个边缘，你希望是什么情况？

536
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:26,568
Well, I can do a lot of things here.
恩，我可以在这上面做很多事情

537
00:27:26,569 --> 00:27:29,136
I could center this label vertically in this container.
我可以使这个标签垂直居中于这个容器

538
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:31,590
Up, you know, vertical up and down.
向上，你知道的，垂直向上和向下

539
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:34,042
I definitely don't want that, I want my label at the top, so I don't want that.
我绝对不希望出现这种情况，我希望我的标签在顶部，所以我不希望出现这种情况

540
00:27:34,044 --> 00:27:35,776
I can make it the equal width, so
我可以使它的宽度相等，所以

541
00:27:35,778 --> 00:27:38,479
I can make this label the same width as the container.
我可以使这个标签和这个容器中宽度相同

542
00:27:38,481 --> 00:27:42,049
I don't want that either, cuz I want this little margin there, right?
我也不想那种情况，因为我想设置这个小边距，对不对？

543
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:45,785
But look at the top one, trailing space to container margin.
不过看上面的那个，trailing space to container margin（距离容器的间距）

544
00:27:45,787 --> 00:27:51,157
This lets me pin the trailing space after my label to the margin of the container.
这让我规定了我的标签和它的容器的间距

545
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:55,194
So that's the one I want, so I'm gonna click on this and it does it.
所以这就是我希望的那个，所以我点击这个

546
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:59,664
Now, see all these yellow and orange lines that appeared when I did that?
现在，当我这样做时，看到这些黄色和橙色的线条出现没？

547
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:03,401
That's because the systems like, okay, you've started telling me the rules for
这就像是系统在说，OK，你已经开始告诉我应该遵循关于这些标签的某些规则

548
00:28:03,403 --> 00:28:06,504
this label, but your you haven't told me enough rules,
不过你没有告诉我足够多的规则

549
00:28:06,506 --> 00:28:08,005
I don't know what to do with this thing.
我不知道应该对它怎么做

550
00:28:08,007 --> 00:28:11,141
So now it's showing you all the places where it's like the system's not
所以它现在正在告诉你，当它被挤压的时候

551
00:28:11,143 --> 00:28:13,310
sure what to do now when this thing gets squished.
系统不确定应该怎么做

552
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:15,745
Before it was like, okay, well you weren't telling me anything so
在这之前，你没有告诉我任何规则

553
00:28:15,747 --> 00:28:18,081
I'm not going to do anything, but now your starting to tell me.
所以我没有显示任何东西，不过现在你开始告诉我

554
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:19,648
So what do I do?
所以我应该怎么做？

555
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:24,353
So we have to fully specify both the what happens horizontally and
所以我们不得不完整地告诉它水平方向

556
00:28:24,355 --> 00:28:25,520
vertically to this thing.
和垂直方向应该怎么显示

557
00:28:25,522 --> 00:28:27,422
So we've only just started here.
所以我们仅仅先从这里开始

558
00:28:27,424 --> 00:28:31,225
So let's pin this edge also cuz we want this edge to stay on this side.
所以让我们拖动固定这个边缘，我们希望这个边缘靠近这一边

559
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:34,528
So I'm gonna hold down Ctrl and drag.
所以我按下Ctrl并且拖动

560
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:38,965
And now I'm gonna pin the leading space to the container margin.
然后现在我想固定它到容器之间的间距

561
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,100
Okay, boom that did that.
好了，我成功了

562
00:28:41,102 --> 00:28:44,670
Still have orange going on here, that's because I haven't specified anything about
这里仍然显示橙色，这是因为我还没指定任何关于

563
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:49,675
the vertical position of this label so I'm gonna pin the top to the top, so
这个标签的垂直位置，所以我把顶部和顶部固定起来

564
00:28:49,677 --> 00:28:54,212
hold Ctrl again, drag up here, this is now top space.
所以我有一次按住Ctrl，拖到这里，这是顶部间距

565
00:28:54,214 --> 00:28:58,882
Notice that it realizes where I am dragging to and from, right?
注意到它识别出我正把它拖向哪里没？

566
00:28:58,884 --> 00:29:00,984
So they can give me options that make sense,
所以它能给我有意义的选项

567
00:29:00,986 --> 00:29:03,186
like Top Space to Layout Guide here.
比如这里的Top Space to Layout Guide(顶部间距)

568
00:29:03,188 --> 00:29:04,921
So I'm going to do that.
所以我会选这个

569
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:06,489
So now I'm starting to get blue lines.
所以我开始看到蓝色的线了

570
00:29:06,491 --> 00:29:07,489
You see these lines?
看到没

571
00:29:07,491 --> 00:29:08,657
I hope you can see that there.
希望你能看到

572
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:11,493
They're solid blue, not orange or red.
它们是实心蓝线，不是橙色或红色

573
00:29:11,495 --> 00:29:16,230
Okay, that's because they're okay, we are okay horizontally here.
这是因为它们ok了，水平方向上ok了

574
00:29:16,232 --> 00:29:18,332
But we still have a problem vertically.
不过这里仍然有一个垂直方向上的问题

575
00:29:18,334 --> 00:29:21,335
Now I'm not sure exactly what the problem is vertically cuz I really don't
现在我不是非常确定这个垂直方向上的问题因为我确实不

576
00:29:21,337 --> 00:29:23,536
want the bottom of this.
希望这样的底部

577
00:29:23,538 --> 00:29:27,773
I just want it to hang out wherever it wants to hang out based on the size of my
希望我这个刚刚摆放的标签的底部是基于我的

578
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:29,041
font or whatever.
字体大小

579
00:29:29,043 --> 00:29:31,610
So I don't, I don't really wanna specify anything here so
因此，我不，我确实不想在这里指明特定的高度

580
00:29:31,612 --> 00:29:34,212
why is this orange and how do I get rid of this?
所以为什么橙色警告会出现，我应该怎样避免它？

581
00:29:34,214 --> 00:29:37,648
Well any time you have orange and when you're doing this layout stuff and
任何时候当你在布局时看到橙色警告

582
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,949
you don't know what to do.
你不知道应该怎样做

583
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:41,885
You wanna go down to this button right here, okay?
你会来到下面这里点击这个按钮，看到不？

584
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:44,905
This is the document outline.
这是document outline（文档大纲)

585
00:29:44,906 --> 00:29:47,924
And when you click this, a little thing will slide out, a little shelf here.
当你点击这里时，这一小部分会滑出来，一个小架子

586
00:29:47,926 --> 00:29:53,095
And this is an outline view of everything that's in your UI.
这是你的UI中所有东西的大纲

587
00:29:53,097 --> 00:29:54,897
Okay? And they're linked, so
并且它们之间已经连接起来

588
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:58,000
if I click the background, nothing is selected.
如果我点击背景，什么都没有被选中

589
00:29:58,002 --> 00:30:00,769
Then the background, the view is what's selected here.
然后这个背景，这个视图就是我这里选择的

590
00:30:00,771 --> 00:30:04,605
But if I click this L0, which means a label with zero in it,
但当我点击这里L0标签时，L0指的是Label中显示内容是0

591
00:30:04,607 --> 00:30:06,240
look it's selected my.
看我的标签被

592
00:30:06,242 --> 00:30:10,143
Zero label, and vice versa if I click on this here, it selects it over here.
选中，反之亦然如果我点击这里，这里显示被选中

593
00:30:10,145 --> 00:30:14,380
So this is this same thing in an outline mode.
所以这和大纲模式一样

594
00:30:14,382 --> 00:30:16,349
This is really nice to have.
这是一种非常好的方式

595
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,317
Sometimes you have views that are overlapping and they're kind of in
有时候你的视图重叠在一起，所以它们显得有点

596
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,421
each other's way, you can always go here to select the one you want, okay?
难以选择，你可以来到这里选择你想选择的视图，ok？

597
00:30:22,423 --> 00:30:27,525
And you can Ctrl+drag to these over here too it's just as much Ctrl+draggable as
并且你也可以在这里Ctrl加拖动，这里和其它东西

598
00:30:27,527 --> 00:30:30,294
some of these other things.
一样可Ctrl+拖动

599
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:32,513
But what we're, and we'll look,
但这些我们将会

600
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,731
  we'll talk about top layout   
         guide, bottom          
  layout guide a little later. 
稍后我们将讨论一下顶部和底部的布局指南。 

601
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:38,369
 But what I really want you to  
          focus on is           
  this little yellow circle up  
             here.  
但是我想让你注意这个黄色的小圆圈            

602
00:30:38,371 --> 00:30:39,870
             'Kay?              
  Any time you got yellow and 
好的，任何时候，你都会在使用auto-Layout中看到黄色和橙色的警告

603
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,172
   orange problems with this    
          auto-layout           
           business,            

604
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:45,108
  you're gonna get this little  
         yellow circle          
   appearing in your document   
            outline.            
你可以在你的左侧文档中看到这个小黄圈出现。

605
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:50,479
And if you click it, it'll slide
           in a list            
      of all the problems.   
如果你点击它，它会展开一个列表，呈现所有的问题   

606
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:54,349
  And so here I highlight over  
         this and this          
  is where all the orange and   
           yellow is.           
如果选中它，出现高亮的部分就是警告所出现的地方

607
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:59,487
It's saying the label with the 0
             in it              
expected the height to be 39 but
它提示这个label的高度应该是39，但

608
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:00,955
    the actual height is 57.    
真实的情况却是57。

609
00:31:00,957 --> 00:31:03,824
Well that's because after I set 
           this font,           
这是因为我在设置了这个字体后，

610
00:31:03,826 --> 00:31:06,460
   I just dragged this down a   
         little bit to          
          make space.     
我向下的拖动了一部分，让它多出来一些区域。      

611
00:31:06,462 --> 00:31:09,262
All right, I, I wasn't very, I, 
            I didn't            
 know it was supposed to be 39. 
好吧，我不是很，我不是很清楚它支持的高度是39。

612
00:31:09,264 --> 00:31:11,330
      I just dragged down.      
我只是稍稍向下拖动了而已。

613
00:31:11,332 --> 00:31:14,283
And so it's saying that's wrong.
这样，Xcode给了我一个警告。

614
00:31:14,284 --> 00:31:17,235
 Now, I could just try drag it  
          back up and           
     meet this dashed line.  
现在,我可以试着将其拖动，和这个虚线重叠。

615
00:31:17,238 --> 00:31:19,738
 This dashed line, by the way,  
强调下这条虚线，

616
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:22,239
 is where it's kind of saying,  
            this is             
really where this thing wants to
              be.               
它表明了这个标签真实的大小。

617
00:31:22,242 --> 00:31:24,642
But the solid lines are where it
            actually            
              is.               
但是实线是我们希望的样子。

618
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:29,313
 So I could kinda drag it up to 
           there, but           
I, I could be off by a pixel or 
所以我可能拖动到那里，但是我也许会相差1个像素或

619
00:31:29,315 --> 00:31:31,749
        something else.         
出现一些其他的区别。

620
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,184
 A much more reliable way is to 
           click this           
 little yellow triangle, 'kay?  
现在有一个可靠的方法，点击这个黄色小三角，好了吗？

621
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:36,186
 So I'm gonna click this yellow 
           triangle.            
我将要点击这个。

622
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:37,854
It's gonna bring up this pop-up 
            window.             
它会弹出一个窗口。

623
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:42,091
 And there's three ways to fix  
              the               
        problems, okay?  
这里给出了三个修改问题的方法，好了吗同学？

624
00:31:42,093 --> 00:31:45,327
  One way, Update Constraints,  
          this middle           
        way right here.       
其中一个，更新约束，在第二个。

625
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:49,098
 That's a way that says, hey, I 
           want this            
          thing to be,     
这个方法是，我想要这样做，   

626
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,199
this label to be right where it 
              is.  
这个label这样才是正确的。             

627
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,967
 So just make some constraints. 
所以只要做一些约束。


628
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:53,634
          Make it up.   
弥补上这个缺点。

629
00:31:53,636 --> 00:31:56,237
        Make it happen!         
让它自己完成。

630
00:31:56,238 --> 00:31:58,839
    And it'll put some wacky    
         constraints in         
 there like 52 high, which is a 
              bad               
它会把一些古怪的约束添加到这个52高度，这是一个坏的

631
00:31:58,841 --> 00:32:02,309
  constraint for it to be, 52   
         high, cuz this         
 label wants to be its natural  
            height.         
约束，因为52的高度不是这个标签真正的高度。

632
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:04,378
 It doesn't want to be 52 high. 
 它的高度不是52。

633
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,346
     So this'll kinda force     
          constraint.           
所以这里就可以用强制性的约束。

634
00:32:06,348 --> 00:32:08,614
 You'll almost never want this  
           one, 'kay.         
当然你也许不希望这样。  

635
00:32:08,616 --> 00:32:11,250
 Rarely do you wanna force the  
          constraints.          
你很少想强制性的去约束。

636
00:32:11,252 --> 00:32:14,520
 Reset to Suggested Constraints 
             would              
    probably just work here.    
这个就是设置label为建议性的约束。

637
00:32:14,522 --> 00:32:16,788
 I'm not gonna choose this one, 
             but it             
      would probably work.
我不会选择这个，即使它可能是正确的。

638
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:21,125
 This one is going to make the  
          constraints           
     match the blue lines.  
这个是将约束调整为蓝色的线条。

639
00:32:21,127 --> 00:32:24,762
 Those dashed blue lines that I 
            told you            
       always wanna meet.       
那些蓝线，我告诉你是必须达到的。

640
00:32:24,764 --> 00:32:28,899
Those are what's gonna help the 
             system             
  pick suggested constraints.   
那些是系统帮助选择出来的约束。

641
00:32:28,901 --> 00:32:32,769
 So since we dragged that label 
           out to the           
     blue lines perfectly,      
因为我们拖动的label是蓝色的，

642
00:32:32,771 --> 00:32:36,639
  I'll bet if I said Reset to   
           Suggested            
Constraints, it might just work.
我敢打赌，我点击了重置约束，它也是能够工作的。

643
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:38,941
             Okay.              
But I'm actually gonna show you 
              this              
好的。我想告诉你这个

644
00:32:38,943 --> 00:32:43,646
last option up on top, which is 
             Update             
  Frame and what this says is,  
           take into        
选项，它是能够更新框架和

645
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:49,918
consideration all the rules and 
           move this            
label to where the rules say it 
           should be.           
所有的约束规则，让label的按照规则进行移动。

646
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,187
             'Kay.              
  And I like this option a lot  
           because it   
好的，我喜欢这个选项

647
00:32:52,189 --> 00:32:55,523
 lets you kind of preview, do I 
            have my             
   little rules right, okay?    
它让你能够预览，我有一个正确的结果，对吗？

648
00:32:55,525 --> 00:32:59,860
So let's try that, let's see if 
           the, we'll           
 tell the, move this label, go  
           ahead and    
我们尝试一下，看下移动后的标签是        

649
00:32:59,862 --> 00:33:03,564
move yourself and size yourself 
            to obey             
these three rules we you put in,
              and   
遵守你自己的设定的那三个约束，

650
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:06,066
 we'll fix the misplacement, so 
           let's try            
              it.               
我们点击这个按钮，让我们尝试下。

651
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:10,269
 And sure enough it did it, it  
           says there           
   are no auto layout issues.   
果然做到了，没有任何问题。

652
00:33:10,271 --> 00:33:14,940
  If I go back to my document   
         outline, this          
 little yellow circle is gone.  
如果你回到自己的目录列表，这个黄色的小圆圈已经消失了。

653
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:18,810
If I look in my view, everything
               is               
 blue-lined, no yellow or red.  
看看自己的视图，全部都是蓝线，没有红色或黄色的。

654
00:33:20,146 --> 00:33:22,630
             Okay?              
         So that's your   
好了吗？这就说明你的      

655
00:33:22,631 --> 00:33:25,115
crash course on auto layout, and
             we're              
gonna talk a lot more about auto
            layout,             
自动布局已经完成，我们接下来讨论下更多的自动布局

656
00:33:25,118 --> 00:33:28,719
 in fact, even on Wednesday I'm 
            gonna do            
another auto layout with all the
            buttons.     
在周三的时候我们将要尝试给所有的按钮进行自动布局。

657
00:33:28,721 --> 00:33:30,671
             Right?             
    The keypad buttons, and     
真的？所有的键盘按钮

658
00:33:30,672 --> 00:33:32,622
 all that, which is a lot more  
          things being          
           laid out.            
这听起来真的蛮多的。

659
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:34,224
But let's see if this fixes our 
            problem.            
接着让我们看下如何修改这些。

660
00:33:34,226 --> 00:33:37,527
   Let's go ahead and run our   
          application           
             again.     
我们再次运行一下应用。

661
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:39,795
 So I'm just hitting that play  
            button.             
点击这个运行按钮。

662
00:33:39,797 --> 00:33:41,563
  Here it, oh, we got our zero  
           this time.        
此刻，我们现在可以看到这个0了。

663
00:33:41,565 --> 00:33:45,334
You see how it pinned this zero 
            to that             
             edge?              
你注意到这个零的边缘了吗?

664
00:33:45,336 --> 00:33:48,036
And not only that, if we rotate 
              this              
            phoned,             
不仅可以这样，如果我们旋转模拟器，

665
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:52,273
    which you can do in the     
        Simulators menu,        
       Hardware > Rotate.    
你可以在模拟器的菜单中点击Hardware>Rotate。   

666
00:33:53,976 --> 00:33:58,378
 Look the 0, this got wider and 
           the 0 kept           
  pin, pinning itself over to   
             that.       
看看这个0，它本身还保持着这个距离。       

667
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,981
 And it also stayed on the top  
          even though           
   this got, whole thing got    
            shorter. 
它也保持着距离顶部的距离，底部距离变短了。         

668
00:34:01,983 --> 00:34:04,884
             Okay.              
  And if I rotate back, the 0   
          stays there.          
接下来，如果我旋转回来，0还是保持原样。

669
00:34:04,886 --> 00:34:07,420
           Question.            
So what did it do at the bottom 
             there?     
学生提问：是什么让它底部产生了变化。        

670
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:10,422
Like what did the actual update 
           frame end            
           up doing?     
就像你已经更新过那里的约束了一样。       

671
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,758
What did the update frame in the
            document            
          outline do? 
在目录中的更新框架做了什么呢？

672
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,693
              Yes.              
 It moved this bottom edge up.  
是的，它改变了底部的边缘距离。

673
00:34:14,695 --> 00:34:17,462
 You see this is only 39 pixels 
           high now.            
你看现在是39的像素高度。

674
00:34:17,464 --> 00:34:18,396
           It was 52.           
之前它是52.

675
00:34:18,397 --> 00:34:19,329
 So, yeah, it just moved it up. 
这样，它发生了改变，向上移动了。

676
00:34:19,332 --> 00:34:21,665
It, it, and if other things had 
              been              
            yellow,     
如果其他事情提示黄色，

677
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:23,133
 it could have moved the whole  
             thing.             
它可能移动整体了。

678
00:34:23,135 --> 00:34:24,718
             Right?             
       It would move that     
好的，它将移动这

679
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,302
  whole rectangle wherever the  
         rule said but    
整个矩形达到约束的那样，但是      

680
00:34:26,304 --> 00:34:29,539
 in this case, you can fi that 
          one problem           
        by moving it up.        
这种情况，你能够向上拖动来修改这个问题。

681
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:30,139
         Good question.         
好问题。

682
00:34:31,342 --> 00:34:32,040
             Okay?              
可以了嘛？

683
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:33,541
        So that's good.         
不错。

684
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:34,976
           All right.           
好的。

685
00:34:34,977 --> 00:34:36,410
 So that's it for auto layout.  
让我们回到自动布局上。

686
00:34:36,413 --> 00:34:38,346
     Auto layout part one.   
自动布局的第一部分。   

687
00:34:38,348 --> 00:34:43,016
 So now let's talk a little bit 
             about              
 connecting our user interface  
           that we're    
所以现在让我们来谈谈我们的界面,我们

688
00:34:43,018 --> 00:34:45,385
 building right here, up to the 
             code,     
建立在这里，通过代码        

689
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:48,254
cuz we want that code to be able
            to talk             
     to the user interface.     
因为我们想让代码能够告诉用户界面。

690
00:34:48,256 --> 00:34:51,157
Otherwise how are we gonna have 
           the number           
            buttons,            
否则我们如何拥有数字按钮，

691
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,425
 make numbers appear up here in 
              the               
            display?            
使数字展现在这里

692
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:56,795
 Or the times button, give the  
           results of           
    the calculation up here.    
或一些按钮，告诉计算结果在这里。

693
00:34:56,797 --> 00:34:58,363
  We gotta be able to talk to   
             this.   
我们必须能够与之交互。           

694
00:34:58,365 --> 00:35:01,633
     So how do we do that?     
但是如何做到呢？ 

695
00:35:01,634 --> 00:35:04,902
 And the answer, first step is, 
           we need to           
  get both this co, this Swift  
             Code,    
正确答案，第一步需要我们在controller中编写Swift代码，

696
00:35:04,904 --> 00:35:10,440
the controller, and this view on
           screen at            
      the same time, 'kay?   
和这个视图相互对应。   

697
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,742
Cuz we're gonna connect them so 
            we need             
them on screen at the same time,
因为我们会连接他们,所以我们需要在屏幕上在同一时间

698
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:17,180
and there's a lot of ways to do 
           that, but            
 I'll do the simplest way right 
             here,              
还有很多方面,在这里我要用最简单的方法,

699
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:20,616
  which is this little button   
           called the           
  assistant editor, all right?
这个小按钮叫助理编辑，好了吗？

700
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,184
  So I'm gonna click that and   
             look!              
我要点击这个。

701
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:25,120
 It put them both on screen at  
            the same            
  time, exactly what I wanted.  
这时你能看到屏幕分成了两部分，这正是我想要的。

702
00:35:25,122 --> 00:35:27,355
 Now it's all a little crowded  
             here.   
现在它这里是比较拥挤的。

703
00:35:27,357 --> 00:35:31,892
   Even if I expand my view a   
          little bit,           
 it's like it's all smashed in  
             here.       
即使我放大整个界面，它看起来还是这么小。

704
00:35:31,894 --> 00:35:35,696
 Luckily the navigator and the  
           utilities            
      can also be hidden,       
幸运的是导航栏这些都是可以隐藏起来的，

705
00:35:35,698 --> 00:35:37,931
see these buttons up here, these
             three              
            buttons?            
看到这些按钮了嘛，这有三个按钮。

706
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:40,734
 This left one, if you click it 
           hides the            
         navigator and    
左侧这个，如果你点击它则会隐藏左侧导航，

707
00:35:40,736 --> 00:35:45,504
 this right one if you click it 
             hides              
        utilities, 'kay?        
点击右侧这个，则会右侧右边的工具栏。

708
00:35:45,506 --> 00:35:50,308
 So now we have both my UI and  
          over here we          
 can still double click to zoom 
            out, but            
现在我们可以看到他们都在视线中，我们可以双击缩放它，但

709
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:54,646
  the thing is, anytime we're   
            actually            
connecting our UI to our code or
事情是这样的,在我们实际连接UI代码或

710
00:35:54,648 --> 00:35:59,183
trying to edit anything in here,
            you need            
 to be zoomed to normal, 'kay?  
尝试去编辑的时候，你需要把缩放比例调到正常。

711
00:35:59,185 --> 00:36:02,353
For example if I tried to select
             if I'm             
         zoomed out and     
例如这个，如果我选择这个比例    

712
00:36:02,355 --> 00:36:04,955
 I try to select this 0 I just  
             can't.   
我就不能选中这个0了。          

713
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:08,891
This is really kind of a bird's 
            eye view            
  just for seeing what your UI  
          looks like.           
这个其实只是一个预览图，让你看看大体样子，而不能编辑。

714
00:36:08,893 --> 00:36:10,726
 If you wanna actually work on  
              it,   
你只有这样才能够继续工作，            

715
00:36:10,727 --> 00:36:12,560
 you double-click to zoom in on 
           this scene           
   that you're interested in.   
你双击选择这个窗口即可。

716
00:36:14,064 --> 00:36:15,630
Okay, so here's our Swift code. 
好了，现在我们开始编写Swift代码。

717
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:17,598
I'm actually gonna delete these.
我将要删除这些。

718
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,635
   We don't need them for the   
          calculator.           
在我们的应用中是不需要这些的。

719
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,671
 We will need these things for  
             future             
application but we don't need it
              for               
我们需要一些计算功能，但这些不需要。
720
00:36:23,673 --> 00:36:24,338
        the calculator.         

721
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,974
 And this is your first look at 
             Swift,             
             'kay.              
接着，你将要开始第一个Swift的编写。

722
00:36:27,976 --> 00:36:31,711
   So Swift, as I said, very    
            concise             
language, but it's basically an 
             object             
我说过，Swift是非常简洁的语言，但它还是一个

723
00:36:31,713 --> 00:36:36,048
 oriented language, it's gonna  
           look a lot           
 like C, some things look a lot 
           like Java.           
面向对象语言，它看起来像C，有人说它有点像java。

724
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:40,385
It's kind of the, you know, best
            of, of a            
lot of different worlds at once.
你知道，最好的，很多不同的地方。

725
00:36:40,387 --> 00:36:44,823
    Now this import is just     
        importing the UI        
        portion of iOS.         
这只是iOS导入UI的一部分。

726
00:36:44,825 --> 00:36:47,658
   You usually won't have to    
         specify import         
   yourself unless you start 
你通常不需要指定导入，除非你开始

727
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:52,496
 using frameworks that are not, 
           you know,            
 the base frameworks and we'll  
          get to that    
不使用框架，你知道基础框架和我们将要

728
00:36:52,498 --> 00:36:56,233
probably weeks into the quarter 
           where you            
fi, finally have to do an import
           yourself.            
使用的一些会需要自己进行导入。

729
00:36:56,235 --> 00:36:58,601
So this how it automatically got
            put here            
            for us.             
这里我们看到它自动的为我们添加了。

730
00:36:58,603 --> 00:37:02,838
And so this is really your first
            line of             
       Swift code, 'kay?        
在这里要开始你的第一行Swift的代码。

731
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,975
Appropriately, it's a definition
              of a              
             class.    
这里是定义了一个类。

732
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:10,479
   Cuz Swift is fundamentally   
        object-oriented         
and here we're defining a class.
因为Swift从根本上来讲是面向对象的，这里是定义的一个类。

733
00:37:10,481 --> 00:37:13,448
  So what does the syntax look  
            like to             
        define a class?   
这里的语法看起来像定义一个类吗？      

734
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:15,416
   You got the keyword class.  
你看到类这个关键字。

735
00:37:15,418 --> 00:37:16,817
 You got the name of the class. 
这里是这个类的名称。

736
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:20,654
 Now this name ViewController,  
           pretty bad           
         name, [LAUGH].    
现在这个名字看起来很糟糕。

737
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:23,523
Okay, very generic, really they 
             should             
   probably be something like   
好吧,真的很一般,他们应该是类似

738
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:26,593
   CalculatorViewController,    
           something            
          specific to           
CalculatorViewController这样的命名

739
00:37:26,595 --> 00:37:33,599
this particular scene that we're
            working             
    on right here, that it's    
          controlling.          
这样看起来就让人清楚他是控制哪里的了。

740
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:35,668
  This is the default name it   
           gives you.  
这是个默认的名字。

741
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,337
   I don't want to spend the    
         valuable demo          
      time showing how to     
我不想花费宝贵的时间去演示如何

742
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,656
 rename this cuz unfortunately, 
重命名这个，因为

743
00:37:40,657 --> 00:37:42,974
  I can't just type a new name  
          here because          
I gotta keep the UI in sync with
              it.               
我不能在这里输入一个新名字,因为我要保持UI同步。

744
00:37:42,976 --> 00:37:45,276
So I would have to do something 
           in the UI            
            as well.            
所以我必须做一些事情在UI中。

745
00:37:45,278 --> 00:37:48,079
  But, for now, for your first  
         assignment or          
     two we're, we'll just      
但是现在，你的第一个任务或两个，我们只会

746
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:51,548
 call this ViewController, but  
            down the            
  road you're gonna wanna pick  
         better names.          
叫他ViewController，但你最好给他更换一个好的名字。

747
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,251
 And of course you're gonna be  
            building            
          multiple of  
当然你可以创建一个         

748
00:37:54,253 --> 00:37:57,554
 these scenes in this class in  
          the same app          
       in the future, so        
新的类在其中，

749
00:37:57,556 --> 00:38:01,024
  of course, they'll all have   
           different            
       controller names.        
他们都有一个不同的名称。

750
00:38:01,026 --> 00:38:07,796
 Okay, this :UIViewController,  
             that's             
    inheritance, that's its     
       superclass, okay?  
这个UIViewController是告诉我们它的父类是谁。

751
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:12,334
Swift is single inheritance, so 
            you can             
  only inherit from one class.  
Swift是一个单继承，你只能让他继承一个类。

752
00:38:12,336 --> 00:38:16,137
It's perfectly fine in Swift not
               to               
  inherit from a class if you   
         don't want to,         
如果你不想这样，它是能够完整的继承一个类，

753
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:18,139
           all right?           

754
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,140
But here we have to inherit from
    UIViewController cuz we 
在这里我们有UIViewController，因为我们

755
00:38:20,142 --> 00:38:23,176
want all this magic that allows 
             us to              
        control the UI,         
想通过它来控制UI，

756
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:27,880
  like that whole auto layout   
         business, and          
 there's a ton of mechanism in  
            here for   
像自动布局功能，这其中有许多的原理

757
00:38:27,882 --> 00:38:31,083
the, the allowing the controller
               to               
        control this UI.      
允许控制器来控制这个UI

758
00:38:31,085 --> 00:38:35,487
 So obviously we do that so all 
ViewControllers, all controllers
            of these            
很明显，所有viewcontroller,所有控制器

759
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:40,425
  little scenes always inherit  
          from either           
 from UIViewController directly 
            or they             
这些小场景总是继承UIViewController或者它们

760
00:38:40,427 --> 00:38:45,296
   inherit from a class that    
         inherits from          
  UIViewController or up their  
           chain so.            
继承的类的UIViewController或它们的链。

761
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:51,134
And then inside this curly brace
           is simply            
 all the instance variables and 
然后在这个花括号中所有实例变量和

762
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:54,070
  methods in this class, 'kay?  
方法在这个类中。

763
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:58,207
So very simple syntax to define 
            a class.            
定义类的语法是非常简练的。

764
00:38:58,209 --> 00:39:02,144
So let's dive right into making 
              some              
 instance variables and methods 
               so               
所以让我们忙于做一些实例变量和方法

765
00:39:02,146 --> 00:39:03,912
  you can see what those look   
             like.      
你可以调整下位置。

766
00:39:03,914 --> 00:39:09,216
   And I thought we, this was   
           segued to            
     because we're going to     
我想我们，应该连接这个，因为我们想要这个

767
00:39:09,218 --> 00:39:12,953
say we wanted to connect this UI
            to this             
             code.              
UI连接到代码中。

768
00:39:12,955 --> 00:39:15,072
       So let's do that.        
我们现在就这样做。

769
00:39:15,073 --> 00:39:17,190
 Let's connect this label right 
           here into            
         this code, and  
我们连接这个label到代码中去，       

770
00:39:17,192 --> 00:39:20,560
  then we're gonna do that by   
           making an            
       instance variable.    
然后我们会通过一个实例变量。

771
00:39:20,562 --> 00:39:23,062
     In Swift we call them      
          properties. 
在Swift中我们叫它属性。

772
00:39:23,064 --> 00:39:25,330
   'Kay so if you hear me say   
           property,            
如果你听到我说属性，

773
00:39:25,332 --> 00:39:27,165
 I'm basically talking about an 
            instance            
           variable.            
那我其实就是在说实例变量。

774
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:29,467
             Right?             
 A variable that is part of the 
             class.             
清楚吗？一个变量是类的一部分。

775
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:31,869
Every instance of the class gets
            its own             
          copy of it.           
类的每个实例都有自己的拷贝。

776
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:34,171
 Hopefully you all know what an 
            instance            
          variable is.          
希望你都知道什么是一个实例变量。

777
00:39:34,173 --> 00:39:35,739
If you don't, again, this class,
如果你不清楚，再说一次，这是类，

778
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:38,408
   heavy object-oriented, you   
             should             
     definitely know that.      
面向对象的，你应该清楚。

779
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,678
  So I'm gonna make a property  
            here, an            
       instance variable,  
我将要声明一个属性在这里，也可以说是一个实例变量。     

780
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,848
 that points to this label, so  
           that I can           
update the label's text, right? 
使用指针指向这个lable，这样就我就能够更新这个label的内容了。

781
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:50,486
  I need to be able to talk to  
          this label,           
 and the way you do that in iO  
              eh,               
我需要告诉这个label，

782
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:55,824
in Xcode is you hold down Ctrl, 
           just like            
   we did when we were making   
在Xcode中，你按住Ctrl，像刚才那样

783
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:59,627
a connection to the edge, so I'm
            holding             
 down Ctrl and clicking on the  
           label, but    
连接边缘，我保持住点击Ctrl和左键在这个label上，但是       

784
00:39:59,629 --> 00:40:02,596
 instead of going to the edge,  
          I'm gonna go          
      into the code, 'kay?   
不是要添加约束，我是想让它到代码中去，

785
00:40:02,598 --> 00:40:06,166
    Now this is kinda wacky.  
这是有点古怪。 


786
00:40:06,168 --> 00:40:07,901
  I know a lot of you are like  
             what?
我知道很多你喜欢什么？

787
00:40:07,903 --> 00:40:08,501
         Into the code?         
在代码中？

788
00:40:08,503 --> 00:40:11,004
             Yeah?              

789
00:40:11,005 --> 00:40:13,506
 So we're going right into the  
           code here            
 and let go and it's gonna say  
              oh,               
现在我们到右边代码中，松开鼠标。

790
00:40:13,508 --> 00:40:16,308
  you wanna make a connection   
          between your          
    UI and your controller. 
你能连接UI和控制器了。

791
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,844
     No problem, what kinda     
         connection you         
          wanna make?     
没问题了，接下来需要做什么？

792
00:40:18,846 --> 00:40:20,846
And we wanna make what's called 
           an outlet            
          connection.  
我们需要设置outlet连接。         

793
00:40:20,848 --> 00:40:22,681
  An outlet means an instance   
          variable or  
一个outlet在实例变量或         

794
00:40:22,683 --> 00:40:25,717
  property that points to this  
          thing in the          
              UI.    
属性，这个指针指向UI。           

795
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:30,021
 And all it needs to know to do 
            that is,            
  what do you wanna call this   
           property?            
接着你需要给这个属性一个名称。

796
00:40:30,023 --> 00:40:34,925
 And this is the display of my  
           calculator           
 so I'm gonna call this display 
             and it  
它将出现在我的计算器，所以我将命名为了display，           

797
00:40:34,927 --> 00:40:38,962
 already knows the type of the  
          thing is UI           
 label of course cuz we dragged 
           from here.  
这是说它是什么类型的，因为我们是从这里拖出来的。

798
00:40:38,964 --> 00:40:41,431
  Don't worry about this weak,  
           I'll talk            
    about that in a moment.   
不要担心这个弱连接，在后面我们会讲到。

799
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:45,067
 And then we just hit Connect,  
             and it             
creates an instance variable or 
然后我们点击这个按钮,它会创建一个实例变量或

800
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:47,202
  property, right here in our   
          controller.           
称之为属性，完成后就出现在这里了。

801
00:40:47,204 --> 00:40:51,339
 So this is a great opportunity 
           to look at           
    the syntax in Swift for     
在Swift中这个语法就是

802
00:40:51,341 --> 00:40:54,109
      creating a property.      
创建一个属性。

803
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,878
 And there's a couple of things 
            on here             
 that are not normally part of  
              it.               
这里有几件事情通常都不是它的一部分。

804
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,516
This is you, the main syntax for
            creating            
          a property.           
这是你的主要语法创建一个属性。

805
00:41:02,518 --> 00:41:04,418
Let's quickly look at this thing
           to get it            
        out of the way.         
我们快速的了解下这个get方法。

806
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,454
 This is not really part of the 
             Swift              
        language proper.        
这不是Swift真正语言的一部分。

807
00:41:07,456 --> 00:41:09,555
This is something Xcode puts in 
            here so     
这是Xcode将在这里

808
00:41:09,557 --> 00:41:14,526
that this little circle, do you 
            see the             
 little circle in this gutter,  
            appears?     
这个小圆圈，你可以看到这个小圆圈出现在这里。

809
00:41:14,528 --> 00:41:18,463
This little circle when I mouse 
            over it,            
     look what Xcode does.      
当我把鼠标移动到上面时候，看看Xcode的变化。

810
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:21,933
 It shows me what this line of  
            code is             
         connected to.          
它展示了我选中的代码所连接的UI。

811
00:41:21,935 --> 00:41:23,852
             'Kay?              
   So that's really cool, and   
这看起来非常酷，

812
00:41:23,853 --> 00:41:25,770
 you're gonna see that's really 
            valuable            
      later in this demo,   
在这个demo中这是非常有用的，

813
00:41:25,772 --> 00:41:27,838
 is being able to find out what 
           things are           
         connected to.         
它能找到我们连接的是什么控件。

814
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,773
 So that's all this thing means 
             here.              
这个就是它所展示的意义。

815
00:41:29,775 --> 00:41:33,777
You, you, you don't type this in
           yourself,            
that when you Ctrl+drag, it puts
           it there.            
当你Ctrl+点击拖动时候你不清楚是什么类型，它所说的。

816
00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:38,748
This weak, all you, you, if you 
           come from            
        other languages,   
这个weak，如果你从其他语言过来到。     

817
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:44,653
   you're used to things like   
            garbage             
collection to clean up the heap.
你会使用过类似的垃圾回收机制。

818
00:41:44,655 --> 00:41:46,288
Or maybe you even have to alloc 
              and               
或者你也许习惯自己分配和

819
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:50,258
free things yourself manually in
              some              
           languages.           
释放管理在一些语言中。

820
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,792
     None of that in Swift.     
在Swift中是没有的。

821
00:41:51,794 --> 00:41:54,828
In Swift, the, all objects live 
             in the             
          heap, 'kay.   
在Swift中，所有的对象都在堆中。        

822
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:58,398
  All class, the instances of   
          classes live          
          in the heap.   
所有类，类的实例都存在类的堆中。

823
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,335
   And the memory for them is   
          managed for           
           you, 'kay?           
替你进行了内存管理。

824
00:42:02,337 --> 00:42:05,371
You allocate them as much as you
            want, as            
 soon as there's no pointers to 
             them,       
你分配他们尽可能多的你想要的，只要没有了指针指向它们，

825
00:42:05,373 --> 00:42:08,274
 they get cleaned up, and it's  
          not garbage           
       collection, 'kay?
它们会自动清理，不需要垃圾回收。   

826
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,493
    It's reference counting.    
这就是引用计数。

827
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:12,711
     It's actually counting     
       references to them       
    but it's all automatic.     
它实际上是计算引用他们的次数，但这都是自动的。

828
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:16,548
The only thing you ever have to 
            be maybe            
   interested in is this weak   
         business which         
你曾经也许唯一感兴趣的是这个weak的功能，

829
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,851
 is less than a hundredth of a  
           percent of           
           the time.            
在小于百分之一的时间。

830
00:42:19,853 --> 00:42:23,788
And for the first four weeks of 
              this              
   class, forget about weak.   
前四周的课程中，忘掉有关weak的吧。 

831
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:27,591
It'll automatically happen when 
             you do             
this Ctrl+drag, but just ignore 
              it.               
当你使用Ctrl+点击拖动时候，它会自动完成，所以先忽略这个吧。

832
00:42:27,593 --> 00:42:29,560
 But the main thing to know is  
            that all            
          that memory           
但是最主要的事情是知道有关内存管理

833
00:42:29,562 --> 00:42:31,128
management is happening for you.
会发生在你身上的。

834
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:34,330
  Also this, instance variable  
          right here,           
同时，实例变量在这里，

835
00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:38,267
   which is a pointer to this   
         object, notice         
    there's no ampersands or   
通过一个指针指向对象，注意到没有与符号或

836
00:42:38,269 --> 00:42:42,271
   stars or any other kind of   
          syntax that           
    says this is a pointer.     
星或者其他任何语法说这是一个指针。

837
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:44,406
             'Kay?              

838
00:42:44,407 --> 00:42:46,540
If you have a instance, variable
               or               
          property or  
如果你有一个实例变量或属性或         

839
00:42:46,543 --> 00:42:48,910
   local variable that is an    
         object, okay,    
局部变量都是一个对象。

840
00:42:48,912 --> 00:42:52,980
it's always a pointer to it cuz 
            objects             
  only live in the heap, 'kay?  
它总是一个指针，因为对象只在堆中存在着。

841
00:42:52,982 --> 00:42:54,648
So you don't need all that extra
           stars and            
所以不需要多余的*和&，

842
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,184
ampersand, any of that business 
           from other           
        languages, okay?        
不要从其他语言中借鉴。

843
00:42:58,286 --> 00:43:01,587
 This exclamation point, by the 
            way, I'm            
   gonna talk about in a few    
            minutes,            
这个感叹号，顺便说一下，我要谈几分钟

844
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:04,023
  has nothing to do with this   
            being an            
         object, okay?          
这是和对象不相关的。

845
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:05,858
 This is, this totally separate 
             thing.             
这完全不相干的事情。

846
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,092
        We'll get to it.        
我们会得到它。

847
00:43:07,094 --> 00:43:08,043
           All right.           

848
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:08,993
     So let's look at this.     
让我们看看这个。

849
00:43:08,995 --> 00:43:15,166
This is the syntax for defining 
               a                
        property, 'kay?         
这个语法是定义了一个属性，对吗？

850
00:43:15,168 --> 00:43:16,066
     An instance variable.      
一个实例变量。

851
00:43:16,068 --> 00:43:18,519
     And it's very simple.   
并且它是如此的简单。

852
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,971
You got var, short for variable 
           cuz that's           
   what this is, a variable.    
你看到var，它是变量的缩写。

853
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,473
 The name, this is the name of  
          it, display.          
这是变量的名称，display

854
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,475
             Okay?              
  That's just the name of this  
           property.    
这个属性的名字是这个。        

855
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,909
       And then :UILabel!       
紧接着就是UILabel。

856
00:43:26,911 --> 00:43:28,510
       Is the type, 'kay?       
这个是它的类型。

857
00:43:28,512 --> 00:43:33,815
That's the type of this instance
           variable.            
这个类似是这个实例变量的。

858
00:43:33,817 --> 00:43:38,452
 So again, I'll talk about the  
          exclamation           
        point later, but        
我稍后会讲到那个感叹号，但

859
00:43:38,454 --> 00:43:42,389
obviously this thing is pointing
            to this             
label so that we can talk to it.
很明显，这是指向label的，我们能这样说。

860
00:43:42,391 --> 00:43:43,590
  And we'll be doing that in a  
            moment.             
我们能够这样去做。

861
00:43:43,592 --> 00:43:44,424
             'Kay?              

862
00:43:44,426 --> 00:43:46,325
           Questions?           
有什么疑问吗？

863
00:43:46,327 --> 00:43:49,962
  All right, let's talk about   
          another kind          
     of connection we may,      
好的，让我们来谈谈另一种连接，

864
00:43:49,964 --> 00:43:52,364
we can make, let's start putting
              some              
   buttons in our calculator.
我们可以，让我们开始放一些计算器的按钮吧。

865
00:43:52,366 --> 00:43:55,100
  So I'm gonna go back to the   
           Utilities            
         window, 'kay?          
我将要打开这个工具窗口。

866
00:43:55,102 --> 00:43:56,734
  By pressing this button over  
             here,              
按下这个按钮，

867
00:43:56,736 --> 00:44:00,705
go down to the bottom, go to the
           third tab            
 over here, the object library. 
找到下方的第三个选项的对象目录。

868
00:44:00,707 --> 00:44:04,775
  And instead of a label, this  
            time I'm            
    gonna drag out a button.  
这次拖的不是label，我将要拖动出来一个按钮。

869
00:44:04,777 --> 00:44:07,143
             Okay?              
 I'm gonna put this button here 
              now.       
现在我要把这个按钮放到这里。       

870
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:11,414
 Just to be different, I'm not  
             gonna              
initially line it up with a blue
             line.              
有些不同，我没有初始化蓝色的线。

871
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:14,283
 I'm just gonna put it kinda in 
           space out            
            here and   
我只是想把它放在这个空间中，

872
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:17,119
 I'll line it up with the blue  
          line later,           
             'kay?              
将它放在蓝线的下面。

873
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,487
 But I don't wanna forget to do 
              that              
though, I always wanna do that. 
但我不会忘记做，我总是期望这样。

874
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:22,724
 What I'm gonna do later is to  
          show you it           
          can be done.          
以后我要做的就是告诉你这是可以做到的。

875
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:26,127
So, this is gonna be, let's say 
            this is             
   gonna be one of our number   
            buttons.           
接着，我们可以说这就是一个数字按钮。

876
00:44:26,129 --> 00:44:30,197
 Like the upper left corner of  
           our keypad           
            is a 7.             
就像键盘左上角的数字7。

877
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:31,598
             Okay?              

878
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:32,998
  Again, I have the same thing  
           over here.      
我还需要其他的一些。     

879
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:35,368
             Okay?              
With the attributes inspector I 
              can               
通过属性设置，我能够

880
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:37,203
  change things like the font.  
修改一些字体大小什么的。

881
00:44:37,205 --> 00:44:40,872
  Let's make this be 24 point,  
           let's say.     
让我们尝试下尺寸为24的。

882
00:44:40,874 --> 00:44:42,791
         I can resize.          
我能够修改尺寸。

883
00:44:42,792 --> 00:44:44,709
  Notice that when I resize it  
         will actually          
       tell me the size,        
注意，当我调整它时候，会显示尺寸。

884
00:44:44,711 --> 00:44:46,978
see it saying there what size it
              is?               
看到它说这是多大的尺寸

885
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,381
 I can also set the size maybe  
           with this            
   size inspector right here,   
我还可以在设置尺寸这里修改，

886
00:44:50,383 --> 00:44:51,348
      type it in exactly.       
类型的准备。

887
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,517
 Maybe 64 by 64, something like 
             that.              
也许64 x 64 看起来更合适。

888
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:54,918
   We don't usually do that.  
我们通常不这样做。

889
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,587
We want things to be kinda their
            natural             
           sizes but            
我们希望它能够是原始的大小，但

890
00:44:57,589 --> 00:45:01,156
just want to show you that there
           are other            
     inspectors over here.      
这里只想向你展示有其他的方法。

891
00:45:01,158 --> 00:45:02,491
       So we have this 7.       
所以我们有这个7。

892
00:45:02,493 --> 00:45:05,460
Now when this 7 is pressed, what
             do we              
        want to happen?         
当7被按下的时候，会发生什么呢？

893
00:45:05,462 --> 00:45:07,963
         What we want.          
我们想要的。

894
00:45:07,964 --> 00:45:10,465
Numbers just start appearing up 
            here in             
      the display, right?    
数字出现在需要展示的地方。   

895
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:13,000
    So that's something our     
         controller is          
      going to have to do. 
这就是我们的控制器不得不做的事。

896
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:17,071
 So, when we touch this button, 
            we kinda            
   want this button to send a   
           message to  
当我们点击这个按钮，我们想让这个按钮发送信息到      

897
00:45:17,073 --> 00:45:21,307
 our controller, and we do that 
           the exact            
  same way as we did this one,  
我们的控制器，跟之前的方式一样，

898
00:45:21,309 --> 00:45:25,911
we hold down control, drag into 
           our code.    
我们按住Ctrl，点击，拖动到代码中。        

899
00:45:25,913 --> 00:45:29,248
When we let go though, we're not
            going to            
an outlet connection this time, 
当我们松开时候，我们不想要outlet这个，

900
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:34,085
because I dont want an instance 
            variable            
 here, what i want is a method, 
             right? 
因为此时我不想要一个实例变量，我需要一个方法。


901
00:45:34,087 --> 00:45:39,790
   A function on my class, a    
        method, everyone        
  understand the word method I  
             hope,              

902
00:45:39,792 --> 00:45:44,161
 okay, so we want it to send an 
          [INAUDIBLE]           
message to our control board, so

903
00:45:44,163 --> 00:45:48,831
  I'm going to pick" action",   
         [COUGH] losing         
         my voice here.         

904
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,433
Bad time to have a little cold, 
              but.              

905
00:45:50,435 --> 00:45:52,968
 [SOUND] So I'm doing an action 
               so               

906
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:56,838
an action is a little different 
             than a             
         outlet, okay?          

907
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,973
  An outlet means an instance   
          variable or           

908
00:45:58,975 --> 00:46:01,909
property, action means create a 
           method for           
              me.               

909
00:46:01,911 --> 00:46:03,944
 So again it wants to know the  
          name of the           
            method.             

910
00:46:03,946 --> 00:46:05,512
  So what does this thing do?   

911
00:46:05,514 --> 00:46:08,815
  Well when I press seven, it   
           appends a            
     digit onto the end of      

912
00:46:08,817 --> 00:46:12,852
   whatever's already in the    
        display, so I'm         
    going to call it append,    

913
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:17,390
 I could call it append seven,  
            but I'm             
actually going to call it append
             digit,             

914
00:46:17,392 --> 00:46:20,859
   because I want to have one   
        method that all         
       of my buttons use.       

915
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,328
           All right?           

916
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:25,796
   I don't want to, copy and    
        pasting a bunch         
of methods, that would be really
           bad code.            

917
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,566
   But if I'm gonna have one    
            method,             

918
00:46:29,568 --> 00:46:33,437
then I need to know which button
               is               
 sending me this message, okay? 

919
00:46:33,439 --> 00:46:37,073
   Luckily, when you haven't    
           actioned a           
    message being sent here,    

920
00:46:37,075 --> 00:46:40,977
  you can specify that it has   
         arguments, you         
  see right here where it says  
           arguments?           

921
00:46:40,979 --> 00:46:45,414
And it can have no arguments or 
             it can             
        have the sender.        

922
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:48,483
Which is the button here as the 
           argument.            

923
00:46:48,485 --> 00:46:52,787
 The only tricky thing here is, 
          and I'm not           
sure why they did this in Xcode.

924
00:46:52,789 --> 00:46:54,455
Hopefully, they'll change it in 
              the               
            future.             

925
00:46:54,457 --> 00:46:59,092
  By default, the type of that  
           argument,            
  which is right here, is any   
            object.             

926
00:46:59,094 --> 00:47:01,961
Now, we're gonna talk about any 
             object             
           next week.           

927
00:47:01,963 --> 00:47:04,330
 But, we don't want any object  
             here.              

928
00:47:04,332 --> 00:47:06,599
We know that the sender is a UI 
           button, so           

929
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:09,935
I picked, click this little blue
           thing and            
   switch this to UI button.    

930
00:47:09,937 --> 00:47:13,672
When you're doing your homework,
             if you             
  forget to switch that to UI   
            button,             

931
00:47:13,674 --> 00:47:15,907
      you'll be sad, okay.      

932
00:47:15,909 --> 00:47:17,541
        So don't forget.        

933
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:21,978
And obviously the event that the
            message             
 is gonna be sent on, touch up  
            inside,             

934
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,448
 just means the user touched on 
          this button           
     and the touch went up.     

935
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:27,116
 While it was still inside the  
            button.             

936
00:47:27,118 --> 00:47:29,952
  That's all a touch up inside  
          means there.          

937
00:47:29,954 --> 00:47:32,021
  All right so when I connect   
             this,              

938
00:47:32,023 --> 00:47:35,824
I'm gonna get a method with one 
            argument            
which is a sender which is a UI 
            button.             

939
00:47:35,826 --> 00:47:38,760
     So let's take a look.      

940
00:47:38,761 --> 00:47:41,695
  So here's your first method   
         declaration in         
          SWIFT, okay?          

941
00:47:41,698 --> 00:47:46,133
 Again it's got this little IB  
          action thing          
 which is kinda like IB outlet. 

942
00:47:46,135 --> 00:47:47,967
  It puts a little dot in the   
            gutter.             

943
00:47:49,104 --> 00:47:50,436
             Okay?              
        So that you can         

944
00:47:50,438 --> 00:47:52,938
see what this thing is connected
              to.               

945
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:59,010
  So this is the normal, Swift  
             method             
            syntax.             

946
00:47:59,012 --> 00:48:02,213
    Starts with func because    
           function,            

947
00:48:02,215 --> 00:48:04,215
   basically that method is a   
          function in           
             class.             

948
00:48:04,217 --> 00:48:06,483
    [COUGH] Here's the name.    

949
00:48:06,485 --> 00:48:07,918
         Append digit.          

950
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,987
And then in parentheses, all the
           arguments            
      separated by commas.      

951
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:12,989
   We only have one argument,   
            though.             

952
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:15,057
  Here's the name of the first  
           argument.            

953
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:18,860
 That's the name we're going to 
             use to             
access it inside of our method, 
              and               

954
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:20,295
       here is the type.        

955
00:48:21,264 --> 00:48:22,496
             Okay?              
       It's a UI button.        

956
00:48:22,498 --> 00:48:24,598
 I, notice no exclamation point 
           there, by            
            the way.            

957
00:48:26,535 --> 00:48:31,237
Okay if this had a return value,
            if this             
 method returned something this 
          one doesn't           

958
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:36,208
   [COUGH] but if it returned   
         something, it          
 would look like this arrow the 
          return type           

959
00:48:37,745 --> 00:48:40,311
okay so that's how you specify a
             return             
             type.              

960
00:48:42,215 --> 00:48:48,185
 Okay, pretty simple the syntax 
            and then            
   inside here we just type,    

961
00:48:48,187 --> 00:48:51,822
well whatever we want this thing
             to do              
  when one of these buttons is  
            touched.            

962
00:48:51,824 --> 00:48:53,774
  So what do we want it to do?  

963
00:48:53,775 --> 00:48:55,725
Well, okay, first of all before 
             we do              
 that, let's go ahead and make  
            more of             

964
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:58,928
  these buttons because I need  
         seven, eight,          
nine, four, five, six, all this.

965
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:01,664
  So let's copy and paste the   
            button.             

966
00:49:01,666 --> 00:49:04,400
        When I copy and         

967
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:07,135
  paste the button, notice I'm  
           using the            
 blue lines to put it perfectly 
           lined up.            

968
00:49:07,138 --> 00:49:11,373
Okay, also notice that it there 
              also              
     sending this message.      

969
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:14,776
 All right, see how their both  
          sending the           
message, because when I copy and

970
00:49:14,778 --> 00:49:18,012
paste, it copied that aspect of 
             it as              
             well.              

971
00:49:18,014 --> 00:49:21,182
So there's another one, I could 
           select all           
       three of these and       

972
00:49:21,184 --> 00:49:27,154
 copy and paste, okay, I could  
           select all           
six of these and copy and paste.

973
00:49:27,156 --> 00:49:30,990
So I can quickly make, my entire
            keypad.             

974
00:49:30,992 --> 00:49:33,343
  Just need to edit the title.  

975
00:49:33,344 --> 00:49:35,695
Now, if while I'm editing these 
            titles,             
sometimes you're clicking around
               in               

976
00:49:35,697 --> 00:49:39,431
here and, you know, you're not a
              very              
       accurate clicker.        

977
00:49:39,433 --> 00:49:43,368
 [LAUGH] Or, you know, you just 
            get out,            
 out of control clicking here,  
            and oh,             

978
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:45,236
  you moved it out of the way.  

979
00:49:45,238 --> 00:49:46,821
             Okay?              

980
00:49:46,822 --> 00:49:48,405
No problem, you can just put it 
           right back           
              in.               

981
00:49:48,408 --> 00:49:51,675
Okay, use the blue lines to your
           advantage.           

982
00:49:52,844 --> 00:49:55,278
  And we'll put our zero down   
             here.              

983
00:49:55,279 --> 00:49:57,713
 And I don't need these buttons 
          so I'm just           
   hit, selecting it, hitting   
            delete.             

984
00:49:57,716 --> 00:49:59,715
 That's how you can get rid of  
           something.           

985
00:49:59,717 --> 00:50:02,985
 And I promised I was gonna put 
           these all            
 on blue lines, so I'm gonna do 
             that.              

986
00:50:02,987 --> 00:50:05,921
     I'm gonna put it right     
         underneath the         
             zero.              

987
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:08,890
So here's a blue line that means
    underneath the zero, and    

988
00:50:08,892 --> 00:50:10,692
 then I'm going to put at this  
             edge.              

989
00:50:10,694 --> 00:50:14,962
So now you can see that the blue
           lines are            
    not just the edges, but     

990
00:50:14,964 --> 00:50:17,965
they are other objects, like the
             other              
   objects in the keypad and    

991
00:50:17,967 --> 00:50:20,667
also now the title, the display 
           rather at            
            the top.            

992
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:26,205
 So I've got all these buttons, 
          they're all           
  sending this message append   
             digit.             

993
00:50:26,207 --> 00:50:28,874
 So I need to figure out which  
             one is             
          sending it,           

994
00:50:28,876 --> 00:50:30,942
   so that I can do the right   
             thing.             

995
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:33,611
So let's start writing some code
             inside             
          the method.           

996
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:37,281
So the first thing I'm going to 
             do is              
   declare a local variable,    

997
00:50:37,283 --> 00:50:39,917
   it's just a local variable   
          inside this           
            method.             

998
00:50:39,919 --> 00:50:43,520
 I'm going to do that by saying 
           let digit            
             equal.             

999
00:50:43,522 --> 00:50:47,824
So I want this local variable to
             be the             
    digit that was pressed.     

1000
00:50:47,826 --> 00:50:50,743
             Okay.              

1001
00:50:50,744 --> 00:50:53,661
  So, first thing that's quite  
           different            
      here is, what's let?      

1002
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:54,363
             Okay?              

1003
00:50:54,365 --> 00:50:56,999
   Why isn't this var, right?   

1004
00:50:57,001 --> 00:51:00,735
Cuz var means variable, what the
           heck does            
           let mean?            

1005
00:51:00,737 --> 00:51:05,973
Well let is exactly the same as 
           var except           
        it's a constant.        

1006
00:51:07,143 --> 00:51:10,744
Which means you're going to sign
              this              
     right off the bat, and     

1007
00:51:10,746 --> 00:51:13,046
 it's never going to change in  
          this method.          

1008
00:51:13,048 --> 00:51:15,415
Now Swift makes a big deal about
           this, and            

1009
00:51:15,417 --> 00:51:19,552
I love this feature, because if 
              I'm               
       reading this code,       

1010
00:51:19,554 --> 00:51:23,355
I know the digit is never going 
           to change            
 all, this might be, you know.  

1011
00:51:23,357 --> 00:51:24,856
 It might have a dozen lines of 
             code.              

1012
00:51:24,858 --> 00:51:26,792
       Which by the way,        

1013
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:28,727
  you shouldn't have very many  
         methods, with          
  many more lines of code then  
             that.              

1014
00:51:28,729 --> 00:51:30,294
             Okay?              
 You want people to be able to  

1015
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:31,796
  kind of see what a method's   
             doing.             

1016
00:51:33,232 --> 00:51:34,765
   You can use other methods,   

1017
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:37,801
 call other methods if you need 
          to get more           
         code in there.         

1018
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:38,935
              so.               

1019
00:51:38,937 --> 00:51:39,835
        Here I can de-,         

1020
00:51:39,837 --> 00:51:41,270
   rely on that not changing.   

1021
00:51:41,272 --> 00:51:44,406
  That's big for readability.   

1022
00:51:44,407 --> 00:51:47,541
  You'll be surprised how much  
         more readable          
it makes the code, to know that 
           this is a,           

1023
00:51:47,544 --> 00:51:49,177
    local variable, but it's    
           constant.            

1024
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:50,111
   Only set at the beginning.   

1025
00:51:50,113 --> 00:51:52,913
             Yeah.              
Is there a reason, constants and

1026
00:51:52,915 --> 00:51:54,715
 like, variables have the same  
             naming             
          convention.           

1027
00:51:54,717 --> 00:51:56,450
Since [UNKNOWN] like Java there.

1028
00:51:56,451 --> 00:51:58,184
Like the naming conventions like
            all caps            
         or lowercase.          

1029
00:51:58,186 --> 00:52:00,770
             Yeah.              
           So, yeah.            

1030
00:52:00,771 --> 00:52:03,355
  The question is, why don't I  
           call digit           
    like all caps digit, or     

1031
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:05,424
 something like that, so I know 
             it's a             
           constant.            

1032
00:52:05,426 --> 00:52:07,626
  That would be a programming   
          style thing.          

1033
00:52:07,628 --> 00:52:10,929
Generally in Swift they don't do
             that.              

1034
00:52:10,931 --> 00:52:13,765
 And, I'll show you why that is 
              in a              
            moment.             

1035
00:52:13,767 --> 00:52:15,233
Why you don't really need to do 
             that.              

1036
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:18,069
  Because you can very quickly  
          find out the          
         declaration of         

1037
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:22,406
  any symbol anywhere with one  
           click, and           
        you'll see that.        

1038
00:52:22,408 --> 00:52:25,209
     Good question though.      

1039
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:28,011
 All right, so I wanna let the  
          digit, equal          
   the number that's on the,    

1040
00:52:28,013 --> 00:52:30,196
      the sending button.       

1041
00:52:30,197 --> 00:52:32,380
  So I'm gonna have to send a   
           message to           
          this button.          

1042
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,316
             Okay?              
  Gonna have to somehow access  
          this button.          

1043
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:37,886
So I'm gonna have to do sender, 
           something.           

1044
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:40,655
  Give me what your title is,   
             okay?              

1045
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:44,091
 So this is a good time to talk 
           about the            
         documentation.         

1046
00:52:44,093 --> 00:52:45,543
            [COUGH].            

1047
00:52:45,544 --> 00:52:46,994
    Because being a good iOS    
           developer,           

1048
00:52:46,996 --> 00:52:50,397
really demands that you are good
               at               
 navigating the documentation.  

1049
00:52:50,399 --> 00:52:54,334
 Luckily, the documentation is  
          really well           
      plugged in to Xcode.      

1050
00:52:54,336 --> 00:52:57,036
For example, if I wanna find out
             about              
            button,             

1051
00:52:57,038 --> 00:53:00,339
 all I need to do is hold down  
           the option           
              key.              

1052
00:53:00,341 --> 00:53:01,373
             Okay?              

1053
00:53:01,375 --> 00:53:02,974
  And watch what happens now.   

1054
00:53:02,976 --> 00:53:04,542
    As I mouse over things,     

1055
00:53:04,544 --> 00:53:09,680
everything, it turns blue with a
             dashed             
   blue line under it, okay?    

1056
00:53:09,682 --> 00:53:10,748
       If I click on it,        

1057
00:53:12,117 --> 00:53:14,884
it gives me a little blurb from 
              the               
documentation about this thing. 

1058
00:53:14,886 --> 00:53:17,954
   So it's saying, you know,    
         here's, button         
          is a class.           

1059
00:53:17,956 --> 00:53:19,288
    Here's its inheritance.     

1060
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:20,689
 Here's a little bit of what it 
             does.              

1061
00:53:20,691 --> 00:53:22,691
And really awesome at the bottom
             here,              

1062
00:53:22,693 --> 00:53:25,427
here's a link that takes you to 
              the               
    detailed documentation.     

1063
00:53:25,429 --> 00:53:27,962
 So I'm gonna click this little 
           link right           
             here.              

1064
00:53:27,964 --> 00:53:34,501
     It's going to be up a      
         documentation          
 window, with UI button in it,  
             hello?             

1065
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:38,038
Did I not click that right thing
             here,              

1066
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:43,076
oh I hope I don't have a network
             issue              
             here.              

1067
00:53:43,078 --> 00:53:47,046
 hm, okay well, I guess I'm not 
           connected            
        to the network,         

1068
00:53:47,048 --> 00:53:50,149
  that's the problem, so it's   
          getting this          
        off the network.        

1069
00:53:50,151 --> 00:53:53,819
            Okay so.            

1070
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:57,488
    Imagine that there were     
       documentation here       
 and, it would have along this  
           side here            

1071
00:53:57,491 --> 00:54:03,294
  on the left all the instance  
          variables or          
 properties and methods of u i  
            button.             

1072
00:54:03,296 --> 00:54:05,929
And you could click on any one, 
              and               

1073
00:54:05,931 --> 00:54:08,165
   in there we'd have a full    
         description of         
            it here.            

1074
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:11,735
   And all the types that it    
         referenced you         
  could click on it here, and   

1075
00:54:11,737 --> 00:54:14,504
 basically it's a hyper linked  
    documentation [UNKNOWN].    

1076
00:54:14,506 --> 00:54:16,773
      As you can imagine.       

1077
00:54:16,774 --> 00:54:19,041
 I'll try to get the networking 
           working on           
Wednesday and we'll take a look 
            at this.            

1078
00:54:19,043 --> 00:54:21,494
 But if I was looking in here,  

1079
00:54:21,495 --> 00:54:23,946
  I'd look down in the section  
           that says            
  getting the button's current  
           state, and           

1080
00:54:23,948 --> 00:54:30,185
   I'd find that there is an    
            instance            
 property there called current  
             title.             

1081
00:54:30,187 --> 00:54:31,552
             Okay?              
 It's unfortunate I'm not going 
               to               

1082
00:54:31,554 --> 00:54:32,186
       link these things.       

1083
00:54:32,188 --> 00:54:33,687
              But.              

1084
00:54:33,689 --> 00:54:39,993
So how do we access, property or
             call a             
   method in another object,    

1085
00:54:39,995 --> 00:54:43,429
   will look exactly the same   
          whether you           
      call it a method or       

1086
00:54:43,431 --> 00:54:46,332
 accessing a property, which is 
            you use             
              dot.              

1087
00:54:46,334 --> 00:54:49,435
             Okay.              
It's the same syntax that's used
               in               

1088
00:54:49,437 --> 00:54:52,771
a lot of languages is to, to do 
              dot.              

1089
00:54:52,773 --> 00:54:55,173
 And so when you do that, Xcode 
          is going to           
            say, oh,            

1090
00:54:55,175 --> 00:54:58,209
  well, here's all the things   
          button knows          
           how to do.           

1091
00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:59,894
             Okay?              

1092
00:54:59,895 --> 00:55:01,578
And as you can see, button knows
           how to do            
        a lot of things.        

1093
00:55:01,581 --> 00:55:03,747
   Because it inherits from a   
           class, it            
     inherits from a class,     

1094
00:55:03,749 --> 00:55:07,451
 it inherits from a class, that 
            all have            
    lots of methods in them.    

1095
00:55:07,453 --> 00:55:10,320
    So when I looked at that    
         documentation.         

1096
00:55:10,322 --> 00:55:13,823
 I've found that current title  
            was the             
        thing I wanted.         

1097
00:55:13,825 --> 00:55:18,194
Now notice as I start to type a 
            c, it's             
      already cutting down      

1098
00:55:18,196 --> 00:55:23,331
    the things that could be    
        starting with a         
 c, and then c u, they cut down 
           even more.           

1099
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:28,770
 I can type tab, to get to the  
             first              
ambiguity point, then I can type
               t.               

1100
00:55:29,739 --> 00:55:31,889
             Okay?              

1101
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:34,040
And then tab again, and I'm here
               at               
  current title and then I can  
         press return.          

1102
00:55:35,243 --> 00:55:35,875
             Okay?              

1103
00:55:35,877 --> 00:55:37,327
        So there it is.         

1104
00:55:37,328 --> 00:55:38,778
  Digit equals sender current   
             title.             

1105
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:45,484
  so, what's going on here in   
         terms of did,          
        descender title.        

1106
00:55:45,486 --> 00:55:49,520
 Let's go ahead and print this  
           out to the           
console just to see what's going
              on.               

1107
00:55:49,522 --> 00:55:50,688
    So I'm gonna print lin.     

1108
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:55,992
At which is a function, a global
            function            
      that takes a string.      

1109
00:55:55,994 --> 00:55:57,694
     So I give it a string.     

1110
00:55:57,696 --> 00:55:59,762
  And inside that string, I'll  
            type mm,            

1111
00:55:59,764 --> 00:56:05,000
  digit equals and now I wanna  
           embed the            
 value of digit in this string. 

1112
00:56:05,002 --> 00:56:08,337
  And Swift has a really cool   
         feature which          
 is backslash open parentheses  

1113
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:11,924
       close parentheses.       

1114
00:56:11,925 --> 00:56:15,510
If you put that in a string, and
              then              
   inside there you put some    
        expression, then        

1115
00:56:15,512 --> 00:56:21,048
it will evaluate that expression
            turn it             
 into a string, and embed it in 
          the string.           

1116
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:24,718
  Okay, so its really easy to   
           print lin            
           values by            

1117
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,487
      using this backslash      
          parenthesis.          

1118
00:56:27,489 --> 00:56:28,254
             Okay?              

1119
00:56:28,256 --> 00:56:30,189
 So let's go ahead and run and  

1120
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:32,123
 see what happens when we press 
             these              
  buttons to see what kind of   
         result we get.         

1121
00:56:32,126 --> 00:56:35,027
It's not going to be quite what 
           we expect,           
         but let's see.         

1122
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:42,066
 Alright so, here's our BUY we  
            got our             
  buttons that's a good start.  

1123
00:56:42,068 --> 00:56:44,435
 And now, and console, where's  
          the console?          

1124
00:56:44,437 --> 00:56:46,269
          Watch this.           
  I'm going to press a button   
             five.              

1125
00:56:47,372 --> 00:56:49,238
   The console appears at the   
          bottom here.          

1126
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,172
      See this down here.       

1127
00:56:50,174 --> 00:56:51,874
      This is the console.      

1128
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:56,277
 And it's saying digit equals,  
          hm, optional          
             five.              

1129
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:57,211
             Okay.              

1130
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:58,746
       How about a nine?        

1131
00:56:58,748 --> 00:56:59,713
     They're all optional.      

1132
00:56:59,715 --> 00:57:01,081
What the heck is going on here? 

1133
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:03,250
             Okay.              

1134
00:57:03,251 --> 00:57:05,418
This is crucial to understanding
             Swift.             

1135
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:08,421
   This is probably the most    
        important thing         
       to understand that       

1136
00:57:08,423 --> 00:57:11,424
  people don't quite get right  
            from the            
             start.             

1137
00:57:11,426 --> 00:57:15,827
 So we're really going to focus 
            here on             
       understanding what       

1138
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:17,862
  optional means right there.   

1139
00:57:17,864 --> 00:57:18,730
             Okay?              

1140
00:57:18,731 --> 00:57:19,597
 So let's go back to our code.  

1141
00:57:22,168 --> 00:57:25,969
And look at this, oh and by the 
            way it,             
 when the console appears down  
             here,              

1142
00:57:25,971 --> 00:57:28,538
  you can make it go away with  
          this little           
           button, or           

1143
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:31,274
you can just drag it out of the 
           way okay?            

1144
00:57:31,276 --> 00:57:34,711
But sometimes it's nice to have 
              that              
    console still there, so     

1145
00:57:34,713 --> 00:57:39,548
  you can look at your output   
          while you're          
 you know reacting to whatever  
           you found,           

1146
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,750
 in fact we will leave that up  
           there, so            
   you can see the optionals.   

1147
00:57:42,753 --> 00:57:45,186
  Alright, so, what's going on  
             here?              

1148
00:57:45,188 --> 00:57:48,956
Well, what's happening here is, 
             well,              
         first of all,          

1149
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:52,759
don't you find this a little bit
            odd, let            
  digit, I didn't put a type.   

1150
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:55,595
         You see that?          

1151
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,663
    How, what type is digit?    

1152
00:57:57,665 --> 00:58:02,334
 Okay, well there's no type in  
           there, no            
type information whatsoever, so.

1153
00:58:02,336 --> 00:58:04,636
    Does Swift have untyped     
           variables?           

1154
00:58:04,638 --> 00:58:06,171
    No, it's exact opposite.    

1155
00:58:06,173 --> 00:58:08,940
 Swift is very strongly typed.  

1156
00:58:08,942 --> 00:58:10,141
             Okay.              

1157
00:58:10,142 --> 00:58:11,341
   All variables have a type.   

1158
00:58:11,344 --> 00:58:12,943
   You have to specify type.    

1159
00:58:12,945 --> 00:58:17,847
 But, Swift is also incredibly  
            good at             
 what's called type inference.  

1160
00:58:17,849 --> 00:58:20,817
 So it can infer the type from  
          the context.          

1161
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:25,554
   So here I let digit equal    
         whatever this          
  is, this current title, and   

1162
00:58:25,556 --> 00:58:29,391
  so it just made digit be the  
          same type as          
             this.              

1163
00:58:29,393 --> 00:58:31,543
             Okay.              

1164
00:58:31,544 --> 00:58:33,694
    Now back to the question    
        earlier, so what        
         type is that?          

1165
00:58:33,697 --> 00:58:37,365
  Well, if I hold down option,  
           okay, just           
     like we used option to     

1166
00:58:37,367 --> 00:58:42,636
go look into the documentation, 
             we can             
  also option click on our own  
           variables.           

1167
00:58:42,638 --> 00:58:44,337
   To see are they constant?    

1168
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:45,204
      Are they variables?       

1169
00:58:45,206 --> 00:58:46,138
    And what type are they?     

1170
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,306
         So watch this.         

1171
00:58:47,308 --> 00:58:50,225
         Option click.          

1172
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:53,143
It says digit is of type string 
            question            
             mark.              

1173
00:58:53,146 --> 00:58:54,579
             Okay?              
     String question mark.      

1174
00:58:55,515 --> 00:58:58,248
    That question mark means    
           optional.            

1175
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:02,585
  So there is a type in Swift,  
          it's a type,          
        called optional.        

1176
00:59:02,587 --> 00:59:04,087
             Okay.              

1177
00:59:04,089 --> 00:59:08,257
  Optional, that type can have  
            only two            
            values.             

1178
00:59:08,259 --> 00:59:10,592
     One value is not set.      

1179
00:59:12,095 --> 00:59:16,997
Okay, this optional is not set, 
           there has            
 never been set or someone has  

1180
00:59:16,999 --> 00:59:20,934
  set it to the not set state,  
         they unset it          
 if you want to think about it  
           that way.            

1181
00:59:20,936 --> 00:59:25,405
  So optional one value is not  
          set, we call          
   that there's a, symbol for   

1182
00:59:25,407 --> 00:59:28,241
it in here called nil, N, I, L, 
             okay?              

1183
00:59:28,243 --> 00:59:31,210
 That means not set, that's the 
          value of an           
       optional not set.        

1184
00:59:31,212 --> 00:59:34,747
That's the only thing nil means 
            in Swift            
 is option this is an optional, 

1185
00:59:34,749 --> 00:59:36,948
the value of an optional that is
            not set.            

1186
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:41,586
 What's the other value that an 
            optional            
could have well the other value 
              is.               

1187
00:59:41,588 --> 00:59:44,655
     Something, it's set to     
        something, okay.        

1188
00:59:44,657 --> 00:59:47,624
 And the type of that something 
            is what,            

1189
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:51,261
    is specified next to the    
         question mark          
            string.             

1190
00:59:51,263 --> 00:59:55,932
 So really you can almost think 
             of the             
question mark there, that's the 
              type              

1191
00:59:55,934 --> 01:00:00,769
optional, and that string to the
            left is             
just saying if this optional is 
              set,              

1192
01:00:00,771 --> 01:00:04,139
what type of thing is it set to,
            in this             
         case a string.         

1193
01:00:04,141 --> 01:00:06,941
    So we would call this an    
        optional string.        

1194
01:00:06,943 --> 01:00:11,846
  But it's really an optional,  
           it's not a           
    string that can be nil,     

1195
01:00:11,848 --> 01:00:14,815
 it's an optional that can be a 
            string.             

1196
01:00:14,817 --> 01:00:16,516
    Everybody cool with that    
           sentence?            

1197
01:00:16,518 --> 01:00:19,019
That's an important sentence to 
       understand, okay.        

1198
01:00:20,055 --> 01:00:23,956
 So, this got to be an optional 
            because             
this current title method right 
             here,              

1199
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:26,525
  returns an optional string,   
         let's look at          
             that.              

1200
01:00:26,527 --> 01:00:29,094
So I'm going to Alt+Option down 
             here,              
             click.             

1201
01:00:29,096 --> 01:00:31,529
   Look at this, this is the    
         documentation          
            for it.             

1202
01:00:31,531 --> 01:00:36,334
It's an instance variable a, a, 
            property            
         on UI button.          

1203
01:00:36,336 --> 01:00:37,267
     Name is current title.     

1204
01:00:37,269 --> 01:00:39,302
  The type is string, question  
             mark.              

1205
01:00:39,304 --> 01:00:41,271
 And this little get means it's 
           read-only.           

1206
01:00:41,273 --> 01:00:42,672
   I can only get the current   
             title.             

1207
01:00:42,674 --> 01:00:44,807
I can't set it, there are other 
            ways to             
     set a button's title.      

1208
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:47,810
   You can't set it with this   
         method or this         
           property.            

1209
01:00:47,812 --> 01:00:51,480
 So it's an optional, so that's 
            why this            
 ended up being an optional all 
             right.             

1210
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:53,081
  Well, that's all wonderful.   

1211
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,549
    How do I get the string?    

1212
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:57,318
I don't want it optional, I want
              that              
        button's string.        

1213
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:02,923
 And the way you do that is you 
           unwrap the           
 optional, meaning you look in  
           there and            

1214
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:08,061
  get the val, the associated   
          value, with           
    exclamation point, okay.    

1215
01:01:08,063 --> 01:01:11,330
   What happens if I put that   
          exclamation           
          point there?          

1216
01:01:11,332 --> 01:01:13,732
 Well first of all, let me show 
            you that            
  when I put that exclamation   
             point,             

1217
01:01:13,734 --> 01:01:17,002
look what happened to digit, I'm
   Option-clicking on digit.    

1218
01:01:17,004 --> 01:01:19,270
 It's not an optional anymore.  

1219
01:01:19,272 --> 01:01:22,507
Digit turned to a string because
               I                
  unwrapped the optional that   

1220
01:01:22,509 --> 01:01:25,576
 came back from current title,  
            got the             
      string out of there.      

1221
01:01:25,578 --> 01:01:28,612
But what happens if this is nil?

1222
01:01:28,614 --> 01:01:30,180
 What happened if this optional 
            is nil?             

1223
01:01:30,182 --> 01:01:34,718
In other words the button option
           has never            
     been set, crash, 'kay,     

1224
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:39,855
crashes your program, so if you 
              use               
 exclamation point to unwrap an 
           optional,            

1225
01:01:39,857 --> 01:01:45,660
  and that optional's current   
          value is not          
  set, nil, then it will crash  
         your program.          

1226
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:50,498
 Now a lot of you might be like 
           whoa, I'm,           
    my products are gonna be    
       crashing all over        

1227
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:55,903
the place and, because there's a
             lot of             
optionals in iOS, I mean a lot, 
             okay?              

1228
01:01:55,905 --> 01:01:58,939
    Most things are probably    
           optionals,           
 because most things, it makes  
             sense,             

1229
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:00,840
they can be in an not set state 
            at some             
             point.             

1230
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:07,746
 And yeah, in this case though, 
           maybe you            
  want your program to crash,   
             okay?              

1231
01:02:07,748 --> 01:02:11,850
 You might want your program to 
             crash,             
  because if you had a button,  
           that never           

1232
01:02:11,852 --> 01:02:15,920
  had its title set, and it's   
         sending a pen          
 digit to your controller, you  
            probably            

1233
01:02:15,922 --> 01:02:20,358
 wanna have that crash, so you  
            can find            
 that bug, before you ship your 
            program.            

1234
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,360
   You see why sometimes fra,   
          crashing is           
             good?              

1235
01:02:23,362 --> 01:02:26,763
 Now if you don't wanna crash,  
           there's a            
way to get around that as well. 

1236
01:02:26,765 --> 01:02:28,164
And I'll show you that a little 
           bit later.           

1237
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:32,802
 But for now understanding that 
          that's what           
  this exclamation point does.  

1238
01:02:32,804 --> 01:02:35,638
  It unwraps that optional and  
           crashes if           
           it's nil.            

1239
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,040
But if it's not nil, it gets to 
           the string           
               or               

1240
01:02:38,042 --> 01:02:40,809
 whatever the optional type is  
          out of there          
            for you.            

1241
01:02:40,811 --> 01:02:44,579
 So now let's go ahead and run  
           again and            

1242
01:02:44,581 --> 01:02:51,318
   we're gonna see that digit   
        equals is gonna         
     say the number, 'kay?      

1243
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:56,556
  It's got the string off the   
         current title,         
no more optional in there, okay?

1244
01:02:56,558 --> 01:02:59,492
             Good?              

1245
01:02:59,494 --> 01:03:03,362
All right, so, now, what are we 
            gonna do            
        with that digit?        

1246
01:03:03,364 --> 01:03:06,715
       We got the digit,        

1247
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:10,067
 we want to append it onto the  
          end of this           
   display right here, okay.    

1248
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:13,972
  And so let's just do that by  
             saying             
         display, dot.          

1249
01:03:13,974 --> 01:03:17,241
   Now, again, if we have the   
         documentation,         
I'd go look in the documentation
              and               

1250
01:03:17,243 --> 01:03:21,712
   it would say oh, there's a   
          property on           
 UILabel, which is what display 
              is,               

1251
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,046
     display is a UILabel.      

1252
01:03:23,048 --> 01:03:25,982
  There's a property and it's   
          called text.          

1253
01:03:25,984 --> 01:03:28,518
      See it right there?       

1254
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:31,053
 And actually, you can even see 
          right here,           
   the type of that, it's an    
          optional as           

1255
01:03:31,056 --> 01:03:36,225
well, because this label's text 
           might not            
  have been set either, okay?   

1256
01:03:36,227 --> 01:03:39,061
  So it has to be an optional   
         string, okay?          

1257
01:03:39,063 --> 01:03:43,297
So I'm just gonna set that equal
              now,              
    display that text as an     
          optional, so          

1258
01:03:43,299 --> 01:03:46,567
 what values can I send it to,  
           set it to?           

1259
01:03:46,569 --> 01:03:51,705
  I could set it to nil, that   
         would be legal         
   because it's an optional,    

1260
01:03:51,707 --> 01:03:53,940
  see, no warnings, no errors.  

1261
01:03:53,942 --> 01:03:55,475
   That would clear out that    
            display.            

1262
01:03:55,477 --> 01:03:57,943
It would not be set to anything,
               or               

1263
01:03:57,945 --> 01:04:00,979
I can set it to a string because
            it's an             
        optional string.        

1264
01:04:00,981 --> 01:04:03,682
  So I'm going to set it to a   
         string and the         
   string I'm going to set it   

1265
01:04:03,684 --> 01:04:08,586
   to is display.text, what's   
          currently in          
    there, plus digit, okay?    

1266
01:04:08,588 --> 01:04:10,087
  So I'm going to append that   
           digit on.            

1267
01:04:10,089 --> 01:04:11,655
     Let's get rid of that.     

1268
01:04:11,657 --> 01:04:14,124
  Okay, now, this has an error  
             here.              

1269
01:04:14,126 --> 01:04:15,025
  Why does this have an error?  

1270
01:04:15,027 --> 01:04:17,093
Anyone volunteer why this is an 
             error?             

1271
01:04:17,095 --> 01:04:18,661
 See it's pointing right here.  

1272
01:04:18,663 --> 01:04:21,897
 There's an error, back there.  

1273
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:24,733
The display.text is an optional 
            string.             

1274
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:27,702
             Bingo.             
Because display.text right here 
             is not             

1275
01:04:27,704 --> 01:04:33,341
a string, it's an optional, and 
           you can't            
  add a string to an optional.  

1276
01:04:33,343 --> 01:04:35,476
  You can only add strings to   
         other strings.         

1277
01:04:35,478 --> 01:04:39,813
 So we need to turn this into a 
           string by            
         unwrapping it.         

1278
01:04:39,815 --> 01:04:44,250
And again, yes, this would crash
             if the             
display currently has nothing in
              it,               

1279
01:04:44,252 --> 01:04:46,185
      it's not set, okay?       

1280
01:04:46,187 --> 01:04:48,887
     Are we cool with that?     

1281
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:49,821
      So let's run again.       

1282
01:04:49,823 --> 01:04:52,857
         [BLANK_AUDIO]          

1283
01:04:52,859 --> 01:04:54,058
           All right.           

1284
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:57,461
 So now 5, oh, it put the 5 on  
             there.             

1285
01:04:57,463 --> 01:04:58,762
         6, excellent.          

1286
01:04:58,764 --> 01:05:00,497
      It's kinda working.       

1287
01:05:00,499 --> 01:05:02,565
   I don't really like that 0   
            though.             

1288
01:05:02,567 --> 01:05:03,966
  That's kinda weak, 0, 5, 6.   

1289
01:05:03,968 --> 01:05:06,669
        That should not,        

1290
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:09,371
that 0 should've gotten cleared 
              out,              
 right, when I first typed that 
               5.               

1291
01:05:09,374 --> 01:05:12,808
  And that's because we really  
         need some way          
   in our controller to know    
        whether we're in        

1292
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:14,777
 the middle of typing a number  
           right now.           

1293
01:05:14,778 --> 01:05:16,745
 Because if we're in the middle 
          of typing a           
 number, we want to append, but 

1294
01:05:16,747 --> 01:05:18,079
 if we're not in the middle of  
            typing a            
            number,             

1295
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:21,182
 we want to start a new number, 
             right?             

1296
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:27,021
So, let's do that, and I'm going
             to do              
that by adding a property, okay?

1297
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:35,628
              Var               
userIsInTheMiddleOfTypingANumber
               ,                
      which you might say,      

1298
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:38,464
    oh my God, that terrible    
        variable, now I         
have to type that over and over.

1299
01:05:38,466 --> 01:05:40,900
This is the last time I'll ever 
            have to             
        type that, okay?        

1300
01:05:40,902 --> 01:05:44,169
Because Xcode is always going to
             escape             
   complete it for me, okay?    

1301
01:05:44,171 --> 01:05:48,840
  So long names are perfectly   
         fine, in terms         
     of typing load anyway.     

1302
01:05:48,842 --> 01:05:50,608
So I like this name so I'm gonna
            keep it.            

1303
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:53,077
     And it's a bool, okay.     

1304
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:54,845
 So I'm typing its, giving its  
             type.              

1305
01:05:54,847 --> 01:06:01,618
  So here's var name type, and  
          notice, look          
at this little error right here,
             'kay.              

1306
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:06,222
Okay, sometimes you're gonna get
           errors in            
   Swift that are completely    
        incomprehensible        

1307
01:06:06,224 --> 01:06:08,724
   to you because you haven't   
         learned enough         
           of Swift.            

1308
01:06:08,726 --> 01:06:11,143
 This one's kind of like that.  

1309
01:06:11,144 --> 01:06:13,561
  You see, it says, class view  
           controller           
      has no initializers.      

1310
01:06:13,564 --> 01:06:19,667
  And that's because, and pay   
         attention, in          
      Swift all properties      

1311
01:06:19,669 --> 01:06:24,271
have to be initialized when the 
           object is            
          initialized.          

1312
01:06:24,273 --> 01:06:29,142
Okay, you can't have a property 
              just              
sitting around not initialized, 

1313
01:06:29,144 --> 01:06:30,977
   they have to have a value.   

1314
01:06:30,979 --> 01:06:32,862
  Now if they're an optional,   

1315
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:34,746
their value can be nil, but they
            have to             
        have some value.        

1316
01:06:34,749 --> 01:06:37,750
 So we can't have this have no  
             value.             

1317
01:06:37,752 --> 01:06:40,052
Now there's two ways to give it 
            a value.            

1318
01:06:40,054 --> 01:06:42,087
  One is, with an initializer.  

1319
01:06:42,089 --> 01:06:45,156
  Unfortunately, I'm not gonna  
         teach that to          
    you until next week, so     

1320
01:06:45,158 --> 01:06:46,557
   you can't do it that way.    

1321
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:51,228
Another way is just to say what 
           it equals            
       right here, okay?        

1322
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:55,298
 And boom, gets rid of all our  
            errors,             
obviously we don't start out in 

1323
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:59,402
 the middle of typing a number, 
            so we're            
  good to go here, all right.   

1324
01:07:01,105 --> 01:07:04,373
So now we have, we know whether 
            the user            
  is in the middle of typing a  
            number.             

1325
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:06,241
 We can go down here and say if 
           the user,            

1326
01:07:06,243 --> 01:07:12,246
 now again, I'm just gonna hit  
          Tab to jump           
past this, maybe a couple times.

1327
01:07:12,248 --> 01:07:14,648
But if the user's in the middle 
           of typing            
           a number,            

1328
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:17,184
then we'll do what we were doing
            before.             

1329
01:07:17,186 --> 01:07:21,187
Otherwise, we're just gonna set 
              the               
 display.text equal to the new  
            digit we            

1330
01:07:21,189 --> 01:07:24,557
       just typed, 'kay?        

1331
01:07:24,558 --> 01:07:27,926
  And we're gonna say that the  
          user is now           
   in the middle of typing a    
            number.             

1332
01:07:27,928 --> 01:07:30,062
           Question?            

1333
01:07:30,063 --> 01:07:32,197
    Why would we have to do     
         [INAUDIBLE] to         
          display it?           

1334
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:34,833
          Initialize?           

1335
01:07:34,835 --> 01:07:37,669
     Why did we not have to     
        initialize this?        

1336
01:07:37,671 --> 01:07:39,988
That's a fantastic question and 

1337
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:42,306
  I'm gonna talk about that on  
         Wednesday cuz          
 there's only one minute left.  

1338
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,908
But that is a great question and
             it'll              
  also, when I talk about it,   

1339
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:48,679
 I'm gonna tell you why this is 
               an               
  exclamation point and not a   
         question mark.         

1340
01:07:48,681 --> 01:07:52,548
    Because I told you that     
       optionals are made       
      with question marks.      

1341
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:55,318
    So why the heck is this     
           optional?            

1342
01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:58,087
   Cuz that's what it is, an    
          exclamation           
point, so we'll talk about that 
           next time.           

1343
01:07:58,089 --> 01:08:01,056
All right, so let's go ahead and
            run one             
        last time here.         

1344
01:08:01,058 --> 01:08:04,793
  And hopefully this is gonna,  
          this 0 will           
   be cleared out, it is and    

1345
01:08:04,795 --> 01:08:07,696
hopefully this will continue to 
           append, it           
              is.               

1346
01:08:07,698 --> 01:08:11,532
 So we're in a great spot right 
          here, we've           
       got a calculator,        

1347
01:08:11,534 --> 01:08:16,904
we can enter numbers in it, next
            step is,            
    we gotta make it do some    
        calculating, and        

1348
01:08:16,906 --> 01:08:19,406
we're gonna do that next time so
             I will             
         see you then.          

1349
01:08:21,042 --> 01:08:24,910
