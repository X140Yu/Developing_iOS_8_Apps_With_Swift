00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,343
Okay, well welcome to
CS193p, Winter 2015.
好的,热烈欢迎来到CS193p 2015 冬季课程

4
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:15,445
This is Lecture NO.3.
这是第三堂课.

5
00:00:15,447 --> 00:00:17,714
This is gonna be all demo.
这节课将全部是演示.

6
00:00:17,716 --> 00:00:21,283
today, my voice is mostly
recovered from last week,
跟上周比我今天的声音基本上恢复了,

7
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:22,918
not 100% as you can tell.
但如你们听到的, 我并没有完全恢复.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,985
But it's getting there.
但是差不多了.

9
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:29,924
So what we're gonna be doing
today is a demo.
好的, 我们今天将要进行一个演示.

10
00:00:29,926 --> 00:00:31,825
We're gonna extend our
calculator a little bit,
我们会给计算器加点东西

11
00:00:31,827 --> 00:00:33,460
we're gonna make it more
powerful.
让它功能更强大.

12
00:00:33,462 --> 00:00:36,629
But more importantly, we're
gonna have it obey this MVC
更重要的是, 我们将会让它遵从MVC

13
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:37,930
design paradigm.
设计范例.

14
00:00:37,932 --> 00:00:39,682
'Kay?
好么?

15
00:00:39,683 --> 00:00:41,433
So it's good, a pretty good
example of showing how
因此, 这是一个演示如何把(计算器里的)内容

16
00:00:41,436 --> 00:00:44,670
we're gonna separate the stuff
into the camps here.
分配到这里列出的区块的好例子.

17
00:00:44,672 --> 00:00:46,138
Now, we're gonna cover a bunch
of other things,
现在我们要讲讲其他的, 比如

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,473
language features and stuff as
I always do.
语言特性和用法这些惯例内容.

19
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:52,143
That's really the primary goal
of these first three lectures
这是前三节有演示的课的最主要目标.

20
00:00:52,145 --> 00:00:54,078
with the demo.
我之所以向你们实时演示

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,012
So I just mean for you to see
it in action because you can
我之所以将要向你们实时演示

22
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:59,750
read all you want about swift
or, about iOS, but until you
是因为虽然你们能读到所有你们想读的关于swift或者iOS的内容

23
00:00:59,752 --> 00:01:02,619
actually see it act, turning
into an app, it's not real.
但直到你看到代码如何成为应用，才融会贯通.

24
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:04,420
So I'm just trying to make it
real for you.
因此我会试着将应用的编写的过程展示给你们.

25
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:08,590
I'm going to go to my last
slide, because,
我会讲完最后一张幻灯片, 因为,

26
00:01:08,592 --> 00:01:11,093
once I go to the demo, I'll
forget to come back.
我一旦开始做演示就停不下来了.

27
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:13,895
Which is just the what's
coming up in this class.
这张幻灯片仅仅是说明接下来这门课要讲什么.

28
00:01:13,897 --> 00:01:17,031
On Wednesday, it's gonna be no
demo, it's gonna be all
本周三没有课上演示,全是幻灯片.

29
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:19,967
slides, it's going to be one
of the few lectures where it's all slides
这种课不会多，但这节是其中之一.

30
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:22,402
But what I'm gonna try to do,
我会在周三的课上尝试划出

31
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:25,205
on Wednesday, is give you the
highlights of this all
划出你们

32
00:01:25,207 --> 00:01:27,307
this reading that you're doing.
现阶段所学重点.

33
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:28,658
Okay?
Because you're
可以么？因为

34
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:30,008
reading a lot of stuff and
it's sometimes hard to
你们要读很多的东西,有时候区分

35
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:32,611
tell what's really important
in there and what's not.
哪些是重点哪些不是会比较困难.

36
00:01:32,613 --> 00:01:34,279
So I'm gonna kinda give you
the highlights so
因此我会给你们划重点.

37
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:36,448
you can get an idea of what's
important.
这样你们会对重点内容有些概念.

38
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,618
And then I'm also gonna start
talking about some of
接着我会开始讲一些

39
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,255
the foundation layer API in
IOS that's the non,
iOS中基础层的非

40
00:01:45,257 --> 00:01:47,891
user interface layer basically and
用户界面 API, 大体上讲.

41
00:01:47,893 --> 00:01:51,227
kinda what some of the classes
are in there.
和其中包含的一些类.

42
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,130
And then also just a little
bit of how we use the language
接着是一点点关于如何使用iOS中Swift 

43
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:57,099
features of swift, and
foundation, in iOS so
 和Foundation 框架的语言特性.

44
00:01:57,101 --> 00:02:00,169
that you can kinda get this
kind of your
这样在一定程度上

45
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:01,870
next Wednesday's lecture ,
本周三的课

46
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,772
is gonna be your baseline lecture,
会成为你的当做奠基课程.

47
00:02:03,774 --> 00:02:07,241
can kinda get you grounded in
how to do all this stuff.
你在一定程度会获得如何做这些东西的根基.

48
00:02:07,243 --> 00:02:10,044
And then next week we'll start
diving in,
然后接下来一周我们开始深入,

49
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,814
to build a more sophisticated
iOS application.
写一个更成熟高端的iOS应用.

50
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:15,682
Okay, I know this is kind of a
whirlwind in first two
好的, 我知道头两周会有些吃力,

51
00:02:15,684 --> 00:02:18,752
weeks, you're learning a new
language, all new system.
你们将在其间学一门新的编程语言, 一个全新的体系.

52
00:02:18,754 --> 00:02:20,920
But hopefully by the end of
this week and the end of your
但是希望在这周以及

53
00:02:20,922 --> 00:02:24,757
second assignment which will
go out on Wednesday you'll be
将在周三布置的第二个作业结束之后,

54
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,225
pretty confident that you'll
at least,
你能够比较确信,至少自己,

55
00:02:26,227 --> 00:02:30,595
you know, have a, solid ground
foundation to build from,
额...有一个的坚实的基础.

56
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:31,662
no pun intended there.
我不是在说笑.

57
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:36,767
There's a holiday weekend this
weekend no Friday section and
这周末有公众假期, 所以这周五没课,

58
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:39,603
no class on Monday until we
resume next Wednesday, and
下周一也没课,直到下周三重新开始上课,

59
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:42,305
the primary thing I'm gonna do
next Wednesday,
下周三我的首要任务是

60
00:02:42,307 --> 00:02:44,341
not day after tomorrow but
不是后天的周三

61
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:46,376
the next Wednesday, is talk a
little more about auto layout.
是下周周三, 是讲一些关于auto layout的内容.

62
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:49,445
Cause you've only just seen
kind of a glimpse of auto
因为到目前为止你们只是瞥见了一点关于

63
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:51,013
layouts so far and
auto layout的内容.

64
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:53,849
I haven't even really told you
how to do auto layout and so
我实际上并没有告诉你们如何做auto layout

65
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:55,383
you're kinda just fumbling
around and trying,
你们差不多只是在摸索和尝试

66
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:58,619
trying to reproduce what I do
so next Wednesday we'll
重现我做过的内容. 所以下周三

67
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:01,588
talk about how to really do
auto layout hm, and all that.
我们会讲如何做真正的auto layout和相关内容.

68
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:05,225
'Kay, any questions before I
dive into this demo?
好的,在我开始演示之前还有没有问题?

69
00:03:06,194 --> 00:03:10,396
Hopefully my voice will hold
out I can already hear it
希望我的声音能坚持住, 我已经感觉到

70
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:14,065
starting to not hold out but
we will see.
嗓子有些挺不住了, 但是...看吧.

71
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:15,266
All right.
好的.

72
00:03:15,268 --> 00:03:21,839
So, I'm going to just go to
Xcode here, launch Xcode.
嗯,我现在点这里的Xcode, 运行Xcode.

73
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:25,942
And we're gonna leave off
right where we, were,
我们将继续上次课程

74
00:03:25,944 --> 00:03:27,410
last time, in the calculator.
计算器程序的编写.

75
00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:32,681
There it is right here, and so
these are UI.
都在这里了, 这是UI.

76
00:03:32,683 --> 00:03:34,783
Hopefully you recognize that
and you did,
希望你们都认出来了并且

77
00:03:34,785 --> 00:03:36,051
did your homework.
做了作业.

78
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:38,070
I hope.
我希望.

79
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:40,088
And here is this area that I
selected at the end,
这是我在代码尾部选中的区域,

80
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,290
which is this area that's
really has not,
这块区域并不是,

81
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:47,928
this is not about how, how the
calculator gets presented on
并不是负责计算器如何在屏幕上呈现的.

82
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,064
screen, this blue area is
about how the calculator is
这块蓝色的区域是关于这个计算器

83
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:52,165
a calculator, okay?
为什么是个计算器, 可以么?

84
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:54,367
This is where all our
calculations are and
这里是存放运算的地方

85
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:57,302
this blue area really
shouldn't be in this class,
这个蓝色区域不应该出现在这个类里,

86
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:00,839
this view controller class
because this is the C
这个视图控制器类. 因为这是我们MVC模型的

87
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:01,973
of our MVC, okay.
控制器(Controller), 好么?

88
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:06,910
And our MVC, this is the C,
this is the V, the view,
我们的MVC模型, 这是控制器(Controller), 这是视图(View),

89
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:09,546
these are the minions that
this controller's using.
它们是控制器使用的小兵们.

90
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:11,948
And today we're gonna create
the M.
今天我们将构建计算器的模型(Model).

91
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,349
Okay?
The model.
好么?模型.

92
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:15,351
The model is gonna be what our calcu,
这个模型将会决定我们的计,

93
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:18,854
what our application is, which
is, it's a calculator.
我们的应用是什么, 也就是一个计算器.

94
00:04:18,856 --> 00:04:20,155
'Kay?
好么?

95
00:04:20,157 --> 00:04:23,758
We're also going to enhance
our calculator the primary new
我们将会加强这个计算器, 我们将赋予

96
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,360
feature we're gonna give our
calculator is that
它的首要新特性是

97
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:30,030
our calculators model is gonna
remember every operand and
我们的计算器模型将会记住所有我们要求的

98
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:32,833
operation you ever asked it to do.
运算对象和运算.

99
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:38,271
Okay, so right now as we do
operations we consume all
好的, 现在当我们做运算的是时候我们假设所有

100
00:04:38,273 --> 00:04:39,505
the operands.
运算对象.

101
00:04:39,507 --> 00:04:41,040
'Kay, they consume, kinda,
they're gone.

102
00:04:42,276 --> 00:04:43,792
So in this case,

103
00:04:43,793 --> 00:04:45,309
we're going to actually
collect all the operations and

104
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:48,346
operands in our, in a stack
and then we can

105
00:04:48,348 --> 00:04:53,350
ask the model to, evaluate
that stack of operations and

106
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:55,385
operands at any time we want.

107
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:57,654
And the reason we're adding
that ability is because your

108
00:04:57,656 --> 00:05:00,256
homework, assignment number
two, you're gonna add two

109
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,726
major features where having
all the operands and the

110
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:06,628
operations in a stack is gonna
be really valuable to you.

111
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,264
So you'll be starting your
second homework with what I

112
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:12,334
do today cause you'll need
this capability to do what I

113
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:13,735
ask you there.

114
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:14,902
Okay, and I'll talk about that
at the end.

115
00:05:14,904 --> 00:05:17,237
If I forget to talk about
that, remind me.

116
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,805
Say, tell us about assignment
two.

117
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:21,240
Okay.

118
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:22,908
So, how do we create a new
class.

119
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,911
Because we're gonna put our
model, 'kay, the calculator,

120
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:28,680
kind of, it, it's the guts, in
a different class.

121
00:05:28,682 --> 00:05:31,983
So how do we create a new
class, in Xcode.

122
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:33,651
We do that up here from the
File menu.

123
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:35,619
We go, New > File.

124
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:38,489
So, you're gonna do File menu
> New > File for a lot of

125
00:05:38,491 --> 00:05:41,291
different things you're gonna
add to your project.

126
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:43,693
Not even just, new classes or

127
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:46,863
whatever, but, when you click
that you're gonna see

128
00:05:46,865 --> 00:05:48,497
there's a lot of different
things you could add.

129
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:49,865
And, we're in iOS, so

130
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:52,267
you're gonna click on this iOS
thing at the top.

131
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,635
And we wanna add a source
file.

132
00:05:53,637 --> 00:05:56,671
And over here we're gonna be
doing this later in

133
00:05:56,673 --> 00:06:00,941
the quarter, this is how we
basically add subclasses of

134
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:04,378
iOS classes, Co, Cocoa Touch
classes.

135
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,446
But we're gonna do today this
one Swift File,

136
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:08,948
you can see it's an empty
Swift File.

137
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,517
And since our model is
completely UI independent it

138
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,287
doesn't inherit, it doesn't
subclass any IOS class or

139
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:17,923
anything, it's just a basic,
Swift File.

140
00:06:17,925 --> 00:06:19,824
So I'm gonna pick on this
Swift File,

141
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:23,394
click Next, and now it wants
to know the name of

142
00:06:23,396 --> 00:06:26,564
it and where we wanna put it,
and we're gonna put it in

143
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:29,466
the same place that all our
other swift files are.

144
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:30,901
Here's our Controller and

145
00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:32,335
this AppDelegate, we moved it
out of the way at the very

146
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:34,571
beginning of the very first
lecture but it's in there too.

147
00:06:34,573 --> 00:06:36,439
So we want to put it in this
same directory.

148
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:41,910
And we're gonna call this new
class CalculatorBrain.

149
00:06:41,912 --> 00:06:43,645
Now, you don't have to have
the name of

150
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:47,048
this Swift File here be the
name of the primary class but

151
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,049
we always do that.

152
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:49,617
It would be kinda confusing to

153
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:52,019
people a little bit if the
name of the Swift File

154
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:54,554
was different than whatever
the primary class is in there.

155
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:55,755
But it's certainly legal.

156
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:56,422
All right.

157
00:06:56,424 --> 00:06:57,556
And Swift, the name of

158
00:06:57,558 --> 00:06:58,857
the file really doesn't mean
anything.

159
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:00,359
It's what's inside that
matters.

160
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:03,461
But, CalculatorBrain is gonna
be the name of our class,

161
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:04,929
our model.

162
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,396
I'm calling it that cause it's
the brain of our calculator,

163
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,898
I'm trying to pick a
descriptive name.

164
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:12,302
Notice the capitalization
here,

165
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:16,306
types in swift, we always
capitalize them.

166
00:07:16,308 --> 00:07:19,409
And we do not put underbars
and other stuff in there.

167
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:20,609
Okay?
We use what's called this

168
00:07:20,611 --> 00:07:25,380
camel notation here, where
every word gets capitalized,

169
00:07:25,382 --> 00:07:27,882
including the first name, word
for types.

170
00:07:27,884 --> 00:07:31,219
Everything else, we don't
capitalize.

171
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:34,755
So property names and things
like that, function names,

172
00:07:34,757 --> 00:07:36,457
those all start with lower
case,

173
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:38,992
they still do the uppercase
and the other words.

174
00:07:38,994 --> 00:07:40,427
That way we, in our reading
our code we

175
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:43,196
can really quickly pick out
what to type and what to not.

176
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:45,164
'Kay?
So please adhere to that.

177
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:48,334
If you don't, you're gonna
look like a newb out there.

178
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:49,501
'Kay.
Calculator brains what we're

179
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,835
gonna call it, I'm gonna
create it.

180
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,121
Here it is right here.

181
00:07:53,122 --> 00:07:54,305
I'm gonna make it my whole
screen.

182
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,975
You can see that the import
here is not import UI kit,

183
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:00,477
it's import Foundation.

184
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,379
Foundation is that layer, that
kinda core services layer I

185
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:05,581
talked about in the first
lecture.

186
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,883
It don't have many UI stuff in
it which is good because our

187
00:08:07,885 --> 00:08:11,687
model is UI independent so
there should be no UI in here.

188
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:15,957
So we would never be importing
UI kit into a model class,

189
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,392
'kay?

190
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:18,826
You can feel free to stop me,
by the way,

191
00:08:18,828 --> 00:08:19,793
if you have any questions.

192
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:22,095
All right, so we're gonna
create a new class,

193
00:08:22,097 --> 00:08:23,029
you already know how to do
that.

194
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:24,364
We just type class and

195
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:27,500
then the name of the class,
it's gonna be CalculatorBrain.

196
00:08:27,502 --> 00:08:31,336
Now, this class is not going
to inherit from any other

197
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:32,537
class, 'kay?

198
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,640
Just gonna be a basic swift,
class.

199
00:08:35,642 --> 00:08:38,509
Now sometimes your model might
inherit from a class called

200
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:40,861
NSObject, and

201
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:43,212
I'll talk about that a little
later maybe on Wednesday even.

202
00:08:43,215 --> 00:08:46,683
You'll get a little bit if you
inherit from NSObject, but

203
00:08:46,685 --> 00:08:50,587
we're just gonna have it be
basic swift base class, 'kay.

204
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:52,388
It doesn't, doesn't need to
inherit any functionality.

205
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:55,224
Okay.

206
00:08:55,225 --> 00:08:56,758
So what's gonna be our data
structure of

207
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:57,859
our calculator brain.

208
00:08:57,861 --> 00:08:59,961
It, it has to be a little
different than the data

209
00:08:59,963 --> 00:09:01,662
structure we used in our
controller to

210
00:09:01,664 --> 00:09:04,565
capture the operand because we
gotta capture operand,

211
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:07,368
operations and operands both
into this.

212
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:12,305
So we want it to be a stack,
I'm gonna call it opStack and

213
00:09:12,307 --> 00:09:14,741
but the type can't be array of
double.

214
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:20,245
Okay, because operands are
doubles but operations

215
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:23,648
are like a combination of a
syn, a mathematical symbol

216
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,651
like plus, times and then also
a function.

217
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:29,186
Function that actually does
the thing, 'kay?

218
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:30,888
So obviously we can't do that
so

219
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,022
we're gonna have to need some,

220
00:09:32,024 --> 00:09:34,691
some new data structure I'm
gonna call that data

221
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:37,760
structure op and we're gonna
define that in a second.

222
00:09:37,762 --> 00:09:41,663
So op is gonna be something
that could be an operand or

223
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,532
maybe it could be an
operation.

224
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:45,233
'Kay?
It could be either or.

225
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:47,519
'Kay?

226
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,804
Now a couple of things about
this here is of course I

227
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:51,572
have to initialize this so I'm
gonna do

228
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:54,575
the exact same thing that I
did in the controller which is

229
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:56,810
I'm just gonna create an empty
array of op.

230
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:59,496
'Kay?
And

231
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:02,181
I'm even gonna use a little
different syntax, 'kay?

232
00:10:02,183 --> 00:10:03,382
We've been using this.

233
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:05,851
I like this syntax because
especially for

234
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:08,553
people who are first time to
swift it's very clear,

235
00:10:08,555 --> 00:10:12,624
this is an array and inside
the array are these ops but

236
00:10:12,626 --> 00:10:17,661
this is evidently not the
syntax that is preferred.

237
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:23,433
The preferred syntax is
actually to do [Op] 'kay?

238
00:10:23,435 --> 00:10:27,070
So this is just an alternate
syntax, putting square

239
00:10:27,072 --> 00:10:29,739
brackets with the type in the
middle for declaring an array.

240
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:32,008
It's exactly the same thing
just different way of

241
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,276
typing in, identical in every
possible way,

242
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:35,777
it's exactly the same.

243
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:37,062
Okay.

244
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:38,346
I think this is a little bit
preferred because if

245
00:10:38,348 --> 00:10:41,449
you ever initialize an array
which will see later.

246
00:10:41,451 --> 00:10:43,884
You use this syntax to create
the array and

247
00:10:43,886 --> 00:10:45,686
put things in it.

248
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,487
So I, I can understand why
they do that.

249
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,257
Okay?
So this is an array of op.

250
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:50,924
That make sense?

251
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,859
Now, let's talk about op.

252
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,094
What kinda thing should op be?

253
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:57,596
Well, we could make op a
class.

254
00:10:57,598 --> 00:10:59,731
An op could have a property
for op,

255
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:02,033
for an operand, which would be
the value of the operand.

256
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:05,169
It could have another
property, which is the,

257
00:11:05,171 --> 00:11:07,371
symbol, mathematical symbol
for the operation and

258
00:11:07,373 --> 00:11:10,173
another property, which was a
function, which does it,

259
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:12,509
and obviously, if the operand
is set,

260
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,144
then the other two would be
not set and vice versa.

261
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:18,481
But that, that's a little bit
weird to have a class that

262
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:21,250
has properties that sometimes
they're set and,

263
00:11:21,252 --> 00:11:23,218
and if other things are set,
they're not set.

264
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,285
It's really not what we want.

265
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,621
What we really want is an
enum.

266
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:31,658
Okay, so you're probably used
to enums in other languages so

267
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,959
I'm gonna create an ema,

268
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:35,728
[UNKNOWN] enum, it looks very
similar creating a class.

269
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,397
I just use the word enum
instead of class,

270
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,633
obviously no inheritance for
enum, sorry.

271
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:45,537
But enums can have functions,
just like the class,

272
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,474
they can also have properties
but only computed properties.

273
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,242
'Kay, the Camry's stored
properties.

274
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,779
So you know enums are kinda
for basic types and

275
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,782
enums are really great when
you have something that can be

276
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,317
one thing one time and a
different thing another time.

277
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:02,585
And never both at the same
time,

278
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:03,952
that's kinda what enums are
right,

279
00:12:03,954 --> 00:12:06,421
they're enumerating different
possibilities so

280
00:12:06,423 --> 00:12:09,257
we could say you know case
operand and we could have

281
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:15,563
a case operation, to have the
different things that we have.

282
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:19,133
Now, in other languages, this
would be as far as we can go.

283
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:21,101
And this would be pretty
useless.

284
00:12:21,103 --> 00:12:24,270
Because if we had an array
that just said whether it

285
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:26,105
was an operand or an
operation, that doesn't help.

286
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:27,973
I need the actual operand.

287
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:30,242
I need the operations
mathematical symbol and

288
00:12:30,244 --> 00:12:31,977
its function.

289
00:12:31,978 --> 00:12:33,711
I need them, they have to be
in this e-mail.

290
00:12:33,714 --> 00:12:36,448
And Swift has a really cool
feature where you can

291
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:41,085
associate data with any of the
cases in the e-mail.

292
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,021
So for an operand I'm gonna
associate the data double.

293
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:48,157
So if my enum is an operand
it'll have this

294
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,558
double associated with it,

295
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,194
that's gonna be the value of
the operand.

296
00:12:52,196 --> 00:12:54,013
And similarly for

297
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:55,831
operation I'm actually gonna
do unary operation first,

298
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,866
that's a single argument
operation.

299
00:12:57,868 --> 00:13:00,768
I'm gonna have a string which
is gonna be the symbol,

300
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,936
the mathematical symbol for

301
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:04,238
it and of course I'm gonna
have a function.

302
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:08,408
Okay again functions are just
types in swift,

303
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,344
it's no different than string
'kay we're just saying this is

304
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:13,612
a function, put a function in
there.

305
00:13:13,614 --> 00:13:15,147
A lot of times we'll do the
curly braces and

306
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:17,883
put a closure use closures to
create our function but

307
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:19,584
we could create actual
functions and

308
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:21,185
pass them in there, that's
fine.

309
00:13:21,187 --> 00:13:24,121
So, and we'd also want a
binary function here that

310
00:13:24,123 --> 00:13:25,289
takes two arguments.

311
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,625
Binary operation and

312
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:30,726
just those two arguments here
in it's function.

313
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:34,296
Okay?

314
00:13:34,297 --> 00:13:35,630
So now we have the stack.

315
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:37,499
Okay.
Which is an array of ops.

316
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:41,369
And these ops are either each
op in this, is array is either

317
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:44,638
an operand or it's one of
these two kinds of operations.

318
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:49,142
Okay so so this is great.

319
00:13:49,144 --> 00:13:53,979
We got this op it's either an
operation or an operand.

320
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:56,882
How are we going to, you know,
put things into

321
00:13:56,884 --> 00:13:59,251
this op stack for example and
something like that.

322
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:01,653
So let, let's go talk about,
the API.

323
00:14:01,655 --> 00:14:05,356
A, API stands for application
programing interface.

324
00:14:05,358 --> 00:14:09,060
API is kind of the meth, all
the methods and properties

325
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:13,230
that make up your class, the
description of them.

326
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:16,066
So I'll use that word a lot,
API.

327
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:18,835
And we really need to be able
to put an operand on there and

328
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:20,736
stack, and we need to be able
to put an operation on.

329
00:14:20,738 --> 00:14:24,573
So I'm gonna have a function
called pushOperand, and

330
00:14:24,575 --> 00:14:27,809
it's gonna take an operand,
which is a double.

331
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:30,578
Okay it's not gonna return
anything yet anyway.

332
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,715
And to push an operand on my
stack, could not be easier,

333
00:14:33,717 --> 00:14:36,217
I'm just gonna say
opStack.append,

334
00:14:36,219 --> 00:14:41,088
you'll remember that append is
a function in array and

335
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,355
the thing that you put on,

336
00:14:42,357 --> 00:14:45,858
obviously has to be this
little type T.

337
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,627
T is whatever you put in here,
so op in this case.

338
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:50,729
So we have to have an op here.

339
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:52,964
How do you create an enum
item?

340
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:58,436
You just Op.Operand and you
give it the associated value.

341
00:14:58,438 --> 00:15:01,539
'Kay?

342
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:06,777
So, very simple kind of way to
create these enums and

343
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:10,013
associate the value with them.

344
00:15:10,015 --> 00:15:11,114
Any questions about that?

345
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,749
Okay, and then how about
operations?

346
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:15,384
We'll have instead of push,

347
00:15:15,386 --> 00:15:18,720
we're gonna call this
performOperation.

348
00:15:18,722 --> 00:15:20,922
And I think when I do
performOperation, what I'm

349
00:15:20,924 --> 00:15:23,024
gonna have is, my calculator
brain is going to have

350
00:15:23,026 --> 00:15:26,493
a bunch of known operations,
things it knows how to do.

351
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:27,861
And when you perform an
operation,

352
00:15:27,863 --> 00:15:30,697
you just specify the
mathematical symbol of it.

353
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:33,533
So the argument here is going
to be symbol,

354
00:15:33,535 --> 00:15:34,800
which is a string.

355
00:15:34,802 --> 00:15:36,301
Okay?

356
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:41,306
So, to append an op on here
that is, an operation,

357
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,274
I'm gonna need to have these
known operations.

358
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,775
So, how am I gonna do that?

359
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,878
Well, to have known
operations, I'm gonna create

360
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,048
another instance variable here
called knownOps, so

361
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,816
my known operations.

362
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,251
And it's gonna be a
dictionary.

363
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:57,019
Okay, now, you read about
dictionaries in

364
00:15:57,021 --> 00:15:58,987
last week's reading
assignment.

365
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:00,489
That's why I have the reading
assignment due today.

366
00:16:00,491 --> 00:16:02,257
Cuz then I can know you've
read about them.

367
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:02,824
I hope you have.

368
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:07,428
And so, how do I create a
dictionary?

369
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,995
It looks like this,
Dictionary.

370
00:16:08,997 --> 00:16:11,531
And it's the same kind of
thing with these angled

371
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:14,434
brackets, because you have to
say for the dictionary,

372
00:16:14,436 --> 00:16:17,036
what type are the keys, what
type are the values.

373
00:16:17,038 --> 00:16:20,506
And our dictionary is gonna
have keys that are strings and

374
00:16:20,508 --> 00:16:22,874
it's gonna have values that
are ops.

375
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:26,478
Oops, sorry, ops.

376
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,913
Okay, and I'm gonna create
one.

377
00:16:28,915 --> 00:16:29,947
'Kay?

378
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:32,316
Everyone understand this?

379
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:34,684
Now, this knownOps, I'm just
gonna put all of the ops that

380
00:16:34,687 --> 00:16:38,955
I know in there, where the key
is the symbol and the value is

381
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:42,392
the actual op, and then when
someone says performOperation,

382
00:16:42,394 --> 00:16:44,527
I'm gonna look it up in the
knownOps.

383
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:47,329
And when I find it, then
that's the operation I'm

384
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:49,531
gonna push onto the stack, all
right?

385
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,183
Make sense?

386
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:52,834
But I have to load this
knownOps up.

387
00:16:52,836 --> 00:16:55,903
Oh, but first of all, so let
me talk about this syntax.

388
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:58,973
Just like array has a special
syntax with the square

389
00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:00,941
brackets, so does dictionary.

390
00:17:00,943 --> 00:17:03,510
So to have a dictionary like
this with this kind of

391
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:07,080
special syntax, we're gonna do
open square bracket.

392
00:17:07,082 --> 00:17:12,752
And then a colon in between
the key and

393
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:15,254
the value type, so it looks
like that.

394
00:17:15,256 --> 00:17:17,789
So it looks very similar to
array, but

395
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,524
you've got this thing where
you've got the key and

396
00:17:19,526 --> 00:17:22,093
the value separated by a
colon.

397
00:17:22,095 --> 00:17:22,660
'Kay?

398
00:17:23,796 --> 00:17:25,429
Same thing, though, exact same
thing.

399
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:27,430
Just a dictionary, strings,

400
00:17:27,432 --> 00:17:28,698
looking up in strings to find
ops.

401
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,701
All right, so how am I gonna
initialize this knownOps?

402
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:33,869
Well, this is a great time for

403
00:17:33,871 --> 00:17:37,906
the first time for you see an
initializer, okay?

404
00:17:37,908 --> 00:17:41,876
So far we've been creating
classes like right here, okay,

405
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:44,311
just by putting these
parentheses.

406
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,680
And I told you that was
calling an initializer in

407
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:47,947
Dictionary, okay, and

408
00:17:47,949 --> 00:17:50,817
this one was calling an
initializer in Array.

409
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,585
And so we're gonna have our
own initializer in

410
00:17:52,587 --> 00:17:55,421
CalculatorBrain, and

411
00:17:55,422 --> 00:17:58,256
we just do that by saying
init, like this, okay.

412
00:17:58,258 --> 00:18:01,726
Now any time someone says
something like let brain equal

413
00:18:01,728 --> 00:18:05,296
CalculatorBrain, with the
parentheses, okay?

414
00:18:05,298 --> 00:18:07,531
It's going to call an init
that

415
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:09,667
matches the same arguments.

416
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:11,668
In this case, no arguments, so
it's gonna call this init.

417
00:18:13,505 --> 00:18:14,070
Okay.

418
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:16,838
Couldn't be simpler there.

419
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,173
So what are we gonna do in
this init?

420
00:18:18,175 --> 00:18:20,375
We're just gonna initialize
this known op, so

421
00:18:20,377 --> 00:18:24,545
I'm just gonna start putting
some known ops into this

422
00:18:24,547 --> 00:18:26,780
knownOps dictionary.

423
00:18:26,782 --> 00:18:31,617
We need our friend special
characters here for that.

424
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:34,253
So let's go ahead and

425
00:18:34,254 --> 00:18:36,888
put, well, let's put times
here first, I guess.

426
00:18:36,891 --> 00:18:39,257
Okay, and we need to create an
operation.

427
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:40,392
How do we create an operation?

428
00:18:40,394 --> 00:18:43,461
Very similar to how we created
this enum.

429
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:47,431
Op, dot, and times is a binary
operation.

430
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:49,566
And you can see that it's
typing this for me.

431
00:18:49,568 --> 00:18:51,735
I'm just pressing Tab to get
along.

432
00:18:51,737 --> 00:18:56,105
This is the symbol, which is
this thing here.

433
00:18:56,107 --> 00:18:58,908
Now, this is kinda bad code
that I ended up

434
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,809
typing this twice in the same
line.

435
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:03,378
If I accidentally use the
wrong x,

436
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,881
like some x from somewhere
else or the x just from my

437
00:19:06,883 --> 00:19:10,451
keyboard might be different
from this x, than this x, ugh,

438
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:12,920
we could get in trouble where
these things don't match up.

439
00:19:12,922 --> 00:19:15,489
So later, in the, right at the
very end of the demo,

440
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:16,857
I'm gonna show you how we
could do this in

441
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:20,960
a way where we don't have to
type this x twice like that.

442
00:19:20,962 --> 00:19:22,161
Okay.

443
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,361
But now we just need the
function.

444
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:25,230
We know how to do that with
closures.

445
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:27,866
We say $0 times $1.

446
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:29,000
End the closure.

447
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,736
And yes, I could put this
closure outside,

448
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,838
since it's the last thing
here.

449
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,107
That is also legal to do when
you're creating

450
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,109
the operations like this.

451
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,310
'Kay?

452
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,377
So that's kinda nice.

453
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:44,880
Let's do our other three
binary operations here.

454
00:19:44,882 --> 00:19:46,982
We'll go divide.

455
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:49,784
And this is where it really
gets annoying to have to

456
00:19:49,786 --> 00:19:51,736
type it twice.

457
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:53,687
But I have to show you
something else before I can

458
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,357
show you how to do that right.

459
00:19:57,726 --> 00:19:58,591
Let's go here.

460
00:19:58,593 --> 00:20:02,362
And there we have minus.

461
00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:04,997
You can see there's two
different minuses there, so

462
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:07,866
hopefully I clicked the same
minus in both those spots.

463
00:20:07,868 --> 00:20:09,434
And then we change these
things.

464
00:20:09,436 --> 00:20:13,671
We know that divide is 1
divided by $0, and

465
00:20:13,673 --> 00:20:15,106
this is plus.

466
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:21,678
And this is 1 minus 0, $1
minus $0, okay, so

467
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,813
everyone cool here?

468
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,483
These enums are really easy to
create.

469
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:31,920
The API of them is really,
really nice, simple.

470
00:20:31,922 --> 00:20:34,055
And then we have our other
operation,

471
00:20:34,057 --> 00:20:37,058
which is our unary operation,
which is square root.

472
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,861
So let's put that in here,
square root is right here.

473
00:20:40,863 --> 00:20:43,830
And we'll put it right here.

474
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:48,267
And square root is not a
binary operation it's

475
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:49,601
a unary operation.

476
00:20:49,603 --> 00:20:53,738
Oops, look at all this.

477
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,591
'Kay?

478
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:59,443
And of course, inside here,
it's square root of $0.

479
00:20:59,445 --> 00:21:01,745
Okay, you remember that from
last time.

480
00:21:01,747 --> 00:21:02,879
So this is good.

481
00:21:02,881 --> 00:21:04,864
Now, while I'm here,

482
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:06,848
I wanna show you a couple
things more about closures.

483
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:07,950
Okay.

484
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:10,052
This, what is this curly
brace?

485
00:21:10,054 --> 00:21:12,721
It's a function that takes one
argument and

486
00:21:12,723 --> 00:21:14,356
returns one argument.

487
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:16,308
And we know that

488
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,259
it's doubles because we're
creating a unary operation.

489
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:21,962
And so, it's inferring the
type here, right?

490
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:23,530
Everyone understand that?

491
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:27,133
Well, there's another function
that returns a function, or

492
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:28,901
there's another function that
takes a double and

493
00:21:28,903 --> 00:21:31,570
returns a double, that does
square root,

494
00:21:31,572 --> 00:21:33,772
it's called square root.

495
00:21:33,774 --> 00:21:36,941
So inside here, we could just
say square root.

496
00:21:38,178 --> 00:21:40,811
Okay, we don't even need this
business.

497
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:44,080
Just wanna emphasize that

498
00:21:44,082 --> 00:21:45,515
we're just passing a function
here.

499
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:47,450
And it can be a named
function, or

500
00:21:47,452 --> 00:21:49,518
we could use these curly
braces.

501
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,754
Now, this is really gonna
freak you out, cuz watch this.

502
00:21:52,756 --> 00:21:57,091
For times, there's a function
that does times called times.

503
00:21:58,728 --> 00:22:00,728
Okay.

504
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:02,729
So in Swift, all these
operators, times and

505
00:22:02,732 --> 00:22:04,664
all these things, are just
functions.

506
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,966
They just happen to be
specified in a way that says

507
00:22:06,968 --> 00:22:09,068
that they can be infix, right,
between the two

508
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,370
arguments instead of taking
the arguments in parentheses.

509
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,138
And we do the same thing here
with plus.

510
00:22:14,641 --> 00:22:16,074
All right, plus.

511
00:22:16,076 --> 00:22:17,508
Now, we can't do it with
divide and

512
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,378
minus because the order is
backwards.

513
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,146
Right, we put the things on
the stack,

514
00:22:22,148 --> 00:22:23,513
we pull them out backwards, so

515
00:22:23,515 --> 00:22:25,081
we can't do it with those,
but.

516
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,086
I just wanna emphasize, that's
what's going on there.

517
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:33,455
Okay, so now we have this nice
knownOps.

518
00:22:33,457 --> 00:22:34,222
So we have this thing.

519
00:22:34,224 --> 00:22:36,724
It's loaded up.

520
00:22:36,725 --> 00:22:39,225
It gets loaded up whenever the
CalculatorBrain gets created.

521
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:41,612
So that's all good.

522
00:22:41,613 --> 00:22:43,997
Now we can use that down here
in performOperation.

523
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:47,134
All right, so how are we gonna
use this in performOperation?

524
00:22:47,136 --> 00:22:50,870
Well, we basically wanna let
the operation equal

525
00:22:50,872 --> 00:22:53,172
knownOps sub symbol.

526
00:22:53,174 --> 00:22:55,240
Okay?
Someone passed us a symbol.

527
00:22:55,242 --> 00:22:56,641
They're trying to perform this
operation.

528
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:58,810
So this is either a plus or a
times.

529
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:00,111
Hopefully an operation we
know.

530
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:02,747
And we're gonna look it up in
knownOps.

531
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:05,683
And the way we do that is with
the subscript notation with

532
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:06,650
the square brackets.

533
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:07,951
Okay?
That's how you

534
00:23:07,952 --> 00:23:09,251
look something up in a
dictionary.

535
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,454
But what might be kind of
surprising to you,

536
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,622
what type do you think this
would be, operation?

537
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:17,959
Any guesses, yeah, some people
are saying the right thing.

538
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:20,128
You'd think this might be an
Op,

539
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:24,498
because I'm looking up in
knownOps right here, a string.

540
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,134
And so hopefully I'm getting
an Op, but this is not an Op,

541
00:23:27,136 --> 00:23:30,971
this actually is an Optional
Op.

542
00:23:30,973 --> 00:23:33,173
Okay, now why is that an
Optional Op, because you

543
00:23:33,175 --> 00:23:35,541
might be looking up something
that's not in there.

544
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:38,344
And it has to return, oh, nil,
sorry, couldn't find it,

545
00:23:38,346 --> 00:23:41,413
so that's why it has to be an
optional, is returned.

546
00:23:41,415 --> 00:23:43,015
So a dictionary,

547
00:23:43,016 --> 00:23:44,616
whenever you look up something
in a dictionary,

548
00:23:44,618 --> 00:23:47,118
it always returns an Optional,
okay, either nil or

549
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,655
the type of thing you said was
supposed to be in there.

550
00:23:50,657 --> 00:23:53,457
So I'm gonna if let here, I'm
gonna say,

551
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:56,827
if I'm able to look up my
operation in my knownOps,

552
00:23:56,829 --> 00:23:59,696
then I'm going to push it on
to my op stack.

553
00:24:02,534 --> 00:24:03,232
Okay.

554
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:06,068
Are you cool with that?

555
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,303
Make sense?

556
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:10,171
Okay.

557
00:24:10,173 --> 00:24:12,407
Now, what's next?

558
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,908
Well.

559
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,541
Now we have.

560
00:24:14,543 --> 00:24:15,509
Oh, well.

561
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,476
I'm gonna take a pause here to

562
00:24:16,478 --> 00:24:18,845
talk a little bit about access
control.

563
00:24:18,847 --> 00:24:20,697
Okay?

564
00:24:20,698 --> 00:24:22,548
Access control is about public
and private.

565
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,017
Okay?
What methods in this class

566
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:27,353
are public, in other words,
other people can use them,

567
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:30,022
other classes in my code
allowed to call them?

568
00:24:30,024 --> 00:24:31,189
And what things are private?

569
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:32,757
My internal data structures
that I

570
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,458
don't want people messing
with?

571
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,428
Okay, so the way public
private works in

572
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:41,064
Swift is kind of interesting.

573
00:24:41,066 --> 00:24:42,999
You basically specify the
things you want to

574
00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:45,935
be private by putting the word
private on them.

575
00:24:45,937 --> 00:24:47,569
If you don't put any word on
them,

576
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:50,639
then they're public inside
your program.

577
00:24:50,641 --> 00:24:52,040
'Kay?

578
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:55,109
And you only use the word
public if you're shipping out,

579
00:24:55,111 --> 00:24:58,979
like, a framework of objects
to other people, and

580
00:24:58,981 --> 00:25:02,215
you want stuff in there to be
public outside the framework.

581
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,684
So I'm making some framework,

582
00:25:04,686 --> 00:25:07,153
a bunch of objects that I'm
trying to sell to people or

583
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:09,555
I get people to use to do
something, and

584
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:12,624
of course I'm gonna have
things where my objects inside

585
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:14,192
my framework can talk to each
other.

586
00:25:14,194 --> 00:25:16,361
There's no keyword needed for
that.

587
00:25:16,363 --> 00:25:18,229
Then I'll have things inside
certain objects

588
00:25:18,231 --> 00:25:20,464
that are private only to that
object, I'll say private.

589
00:25:20,466 --> 00:25:24,267
And them some of them might be
public that the customer who's

590
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:27,404
buying my objects, my
framework, can use.

591
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:29,238
Now, in this class we're not
gonna be doing frameworks,

592
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,840
we don't really have time to
get to that, so

593
00:25:30,842 --> 00:25:32,508
we're not gonna be using the
keyword public,

594
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,076
we won't ever use that,

595
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:35,510
because we don't have any
frameworks.

596
00:25:35,512 --> 00:25:37,578
But we are gonna use private.

597
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,180
And, starting with assignment
two,

598
00:25:40,216 --> 00:25:42,516
it's one of your evaluation
criteria is gonna be,

599
00:25:42,518 --> 00:25:44,918
make private things private.

600
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,985
'Kay?

601
00:25:45,987 --> 00:25:47,453
So that is important to do.

602
00:25:47,455 --> 00:25:48,354
And you could just say,

603
00:25:48,356 --> 00:25:49,988
well, I like everything to be
public.

604
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,156
Well, that's bad.

605
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:53,391
Okay?
If you make your

606
00:25:53,392 --> 00:25:55,625
internal structure public, and
some other object in your

607
00:25:55,628 --> 00:25:58,796
program starts mucking with it
and breaks your object, and

608
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:00,931
then you come to a new version
of your program, and

609
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:03,467
you change something, and now
everybody's breaking.

610
00:26:03,469 --> 00:26:05,335
That's bad, okay, that's
chaos.

611
00:26:05,337 --> 00:26:08,671
So the only things that want
to be not private are things

612
00:26:08,673 --> 00:26:11,507
that you're committing to sign
up to support.

613
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:14,677
So in this class, the only
public things so

614
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:17,279
far are the initializer.

615
00:26:17,281 --> 00:26:18,513
Obviously, we want to allow
people to

616
00:26:18,515 --> 00:26:19,847
create a CalculatorBrain.

617
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:21,349
That's clearly public.

618
00:26:21,351 --> 00:26:25,385
Also pushing and performing
operands and operations.

619
00:26:25,387 --> 00:26:26,586
That's public.

620
00:26:26,588 --> 00:26:28,238
Okay?

621
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:29,889
Everything else, for now, I'm
gonna make private.

622
00:26:29,891 --> 00:26:31,657
So I'm gonna make this
private.

623
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:33,592
Notice that if I make this
private,

624
00:26:33,594 --> 00:26:35,427
it's gonna start saying, whoa,

625
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:38,730
wait a second, this can't be
public, you know, it can't be

626
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:42,100
non-private because this is
private and it uses it.

627
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,368
That's what this warning's
gonna say right here, see.

628
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,720
Property must be

629
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:47,071
declared private because its
type is private.

630
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:48,205
Okay, that's the type of this.

631
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,906
But I want this to be private
anyway,

632
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,742
this is my internal data
structure, opStack.

633
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:56,278
Now, knownOps is kind of an
interesting one.

634
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,614
Maybe I would want that to be
public one day,

635
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:01,650
because maybe I want people to
use my calculator brain and

636
00:27:01,652 --> 00:27:03,685
teach it new ops.

637
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:05,386
That wouldn't be that
unreasonable.

638
00:27:05,388 --> 00:27:08,356
However, I'm not ready to
support that functionality in

639
00:27:08,358 --> 00:27:09,456
my CalculatorBrain.

640
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:12,059
I'm just not sure I wanna do
it this way.

641
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:13,827
Maybe I don't want this
property to be public,

642
00:27:13,829 --> 00:27:17,263
I might want to just have some
functions to learn an op or

643
00:27:17,265 --> 00:27:18,982
something like that, so

644
00:27:18,983 --> 00:27:20,700
I'm just not sure, so I'm
gonna start out private.

645
00:27:20,702 --> 00:27:23,268
And that's really, when you're
designing APIs,

646
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,536
you wanna kinda start out,

647
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:27,405
make it private first, and
then open it up as you're

648
00:27:27,407 --> 00:27:30,308
willing to support that
functionality.

649
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,709
Question?
>> Is the common view in

650
00:27:31,711 --> 00:27:34,278
Swift to make most instance
variables private and

651
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,980
use getters and setters, or is
it to make them, if,

652
00:27:36,982 --> 00:27:38,882
if they are supposed to be
public, or

653
00:27:38,884 --> 00:27:40,683
make them public and then let
the?

654
00:27:40,685 --> 00:27:43,052
>> All right.
So the question is, is it,

655
00:27:43,054 --> 00:27:45,854
is it kind of part of the
Swift way to make

656
00:27:45,856 --> 00:27:47,889
most instant variables private
and

657
00:27:47,891 --> 00:27:50,759
then have getters and setters
that are public to get them.

658
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:52,226
That doesn't really even make
sense in Swift.

659
00:27:52,228 --> 00:27:53,961
That's more of an Objective-C
thing.

660
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,263
In Objective-C, you had
instance variables, and

661
00:27:56,265 --> 00:27:59,032
then you had properties that
would get and set them.

662
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:00,967
And Swift has kind of merged
those a little bit

663
00:28:00,969 --> 00:28:05,638
closer together so that
properties are really kind of

664
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,907
the public or private getters
and setters.

665
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:11,043
So, if you have a property,
you just have to

666
00:28:11,045 --> 00:28:13,178
decide whether you want people
to access it or

667
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,246
not, and if not, make it
private.

668
00:28:15,248 --> 00:28:16,681
And if so, make it public.

669
00:28:16,683 --> 00:28:19,350
And that, you know, don't make
it non-private, basically.

670
00:28:19,352 --> 00:28:21,685
And that's, just that's all
you need to think about.

671
00:28:21,687 --> 00:28:24,854
I wouldn't even think in Swift
in terms of instance variable

672
00:28:24,856 --> 00:28:26,289
versus the property.

673
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:28,557
Now, it is still possible in
Swift to do that,

674
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,526
because you have computed
properties.

675
00:28:30,528 --> 00:28:32,328
And those could be setters and

676
00:28:32,329 --> 00:28:34,129
getters that are setting
private properties.

677
00:28:34,131 --> 00:28:36,464
But we're gonna see on
Wednesday, even,

678
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:39,634
I'm gonna talk to you a little
bit about a way that when your

679
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,902
properties get set, you can
intervene,

680
00:28:41,904 --> 00:28:44,571
you can check them to make
sure the value is okay.

681
00:28:44,573 --> 00:28:46,373
So if you have a public
property,

682
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:49,142
you can still protect it by
intervening a little bit

683
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,110
when people set it or try and
get it.

684
00:28:51,112 --> 00:28:52,912
So it is possible to still
have some protection there,

685
00:28:52,914 --> 00:28:53,545
we'll see that.

686
00:28:56,016 --> 00:28:57,749
All right, so these are our
only public things.

687
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:00,651
Now, there's only one other
public thing we need to do in

688
00:29:00,653 --> 00:29:02,420
our CalculatorBrain, which is,

689
00:29:02,422 --> 00:29:04,688
we need to let people evaluate
this stack.

690
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:09,492
So people are pushing operands
and performing operations,

691
00:29:09,494 --> 00:29:11,828
now they wanna know what's the
result.

692
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,979
Okay?
They

693
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,129
pushed an operand of a five.

694
00:29:14,132 --> 00:29:15,898
They pushed an operand of a
four.

695
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,166
They performed operation plus,

696
00:29:18,168 --> 00:29:19,668
they want to see four plus
five.

697
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,202
Where's that nine, okay?

698
00:29:21,204 --> 00:29:22,403
They need the result.

699
00:29:22,405 --> 00:29:25,606
So we need another public
method here,

700
00:29:25,608 --> 00:29:29,876
which I'm gonna call evaluate.

701
00:29:29,878 --> 00:29:31,344
'Kay?
And evaluate,

702
00:29:31,346 --> 00:29:34,880
we could have it return a
double, for example.

703
00:29:34,882 --> 00:29:38,917
And it would just evaluate
this opStack and

704
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:40,535
return the value.

705
00:29:40,536 --> 00:29:42,152
But I really can't make this a
double.

706
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,524
Really, this has to be an
optional.

707
00:29:46,526 --> 00:29:48,892
'Kay, why does this have to be
an optional?

708
00:29:48,894 --> 00:29:52,295
Well, that's because someone
might get my CalculatorBrain,

709
00:29:52,297 --> 00:29:53,963
and the first thing they do
is,

710
00:29:53,965 --> 00:29:55,932
they say, perform operation
plus.

711
00:29:55,934 --> 00:29:57,600
Okay, well I have no operands.

712
00:29:57,602 --> 00:29:59,051
Okay?
And

713
00:29:59,052 --> 00:30:00,501
you're asking to evaluate
plus.

714
00:30:00,504 --> 00:30:02,287
I can't do that.

715
00:30:02,288 --> 00:30:04,071
So, I have to return something
to you, that lets you know,

716
00:30:04,074 --> 00:30:07,776
I could not evaluate what you
ask me to evaluate.

717
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:09,477
So, I'm gonna return nil in
that case,

718
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:12,213
so valuate here really needs
to be an optional.

719
00:30:13,249 --> 00:30:14,848
'Kay, so you can see some of
the thinking,

720
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,283
when do you make something an
optional when not.

721
00:30:17,285 --> 00:30:19,285
'Kay, so this is a classic
case of that,

722
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:21,787
where you got sometimes you
wanna return it and

723
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:23,889
you can't do it, so you have
to return no.

724
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:28,793
All right, so how we going to
implement evaluate?

725
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:30,595
Okay, how many people in the
class,

726
00:30:30,597 --> 00:30:34,365
raise your hands don't be shy,
are you comfortable with

727
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:37,067
the computer science concept
of recursion?

728
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:40,903
Okay.
Excellent, that's about 80 or

729
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,939
90%, so I'm gonna explain this
really fast then.

730
00:30:43,941 --> 00:30:45,974
And if you don't understand
recursion,

731
00:30:45,976 --> 00:30:47,309
if you didn't raise your hand,

732
00:30:47,311 --> 00:30:48,843
that's something you should go
review.

733
00:30:48,845 --> 00:30:50,378
Okay?
[LAUGH] Recursion is

734
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:51,912
something, you should know by
the time you take this class,

735
00:30:51,915 --> 00:30:53,714
so that's something you
definitely wanna know.

736
00:30:53,716 --> 00:30:57,317
So, how are we going to use
recursion to

737
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:59,252
evaluate this stack?

738
00:30:59,254 --> 00:31:00,653
All right, looks like this.

739
00:31:00,655 --> 00:31:02,988
I'm gonna do a sample stack,
right here.

740
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:08,393
So, let's say I put a 6 on the
stack, and then I put a 5, and

741
00:31:08,395 --> 00:31:14,065
then I put a plus, and then I
put a 4, and then I put times.

742
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:15,166
Okay?

743
00:31:15,168 --> 00:31:17,968
So here's our stack, and I'm
gonna evaluate this,

744
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:18,702
I'm gonna recursion.

745
00:31:18,704 --> 00:31:19,769
How am I gonna do that?

746
00:31:19,771 --> 00:31:21,437
Well, really, what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna

747
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:24,740
have a helper method here, a
recursive helper method.

748
00:31:24,742 --> 00:31:27,543
I'm gonna call it evaluate
also, actually.

749
00:31:27,545 --> 00:31:29,644
And it's gonna take a stack,
as an argument,

750
00:31:29,646 --> 00:31:31,012
a stack of things to evaluate.

751
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,449
And it's only gonna evaluate
the top thing on the stack.

752
00:31:34,451 --> 00:31:36,717
That's it just gonna value the
top of the stack and

753
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:38,819
return it, but the top thing
of the stack might

754
00:31:38,821 --> 00:31:41,421
involve looking at every
single of one of these, right?

755
00:31:41,423 --> 00:31:44,157
Cuz, this times needed to two
operations.

756
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,026
So, lets look at this, this
recursive evaluates gonna come

757
00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:48,961
in here, it's gonna try and

758
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:50,895
evaluate the top of the stack,
which is a times.

759
00:31:50,898 --> 00:31:51,597
Okay?
So it's like,

760
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:53,265
okay, I'm doing times.

761
00:31:53,267 --> 00:31:56,101
Now for times it needs two
operate,

762
00:31:56,103 --> 00:31:58,302
two operands here for times.

763
00:31:58,304 --> 00:31:59,737
So, it recursively calls,

764
00:31:59,739 --> 00:32:03,807
itself to say give me to first
operand for time.

765
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:07,010
And so recursively, comes in
here, it finds a 4 on

766
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:10,913
the top it's like, I know how
to evaluate 4, it's 4.

767
00:32:10,915 --> 00:32:12,148
So, it just returns.

768
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:15,751
Okay, so now I have my first
operands.

769
00:32:15,753 --> 00:32:16,618
'Kay?
Now,

770
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,386
I take the rest of the stack
and

771
00:32:18,388 --> 00:32:21,255
evaluate it, to get the second
one.

772
00:32:21,257 --> 00:32:24,291
And when I do that, I get
plus, 'kay?

773
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:26,393
So, plus says, oh, I have to
evaluate plus.

774
00:32:26,395 --> 00:32:27,727
It needs operands.

775
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:30,763
So, I come over here, I'm
getting a plus.

776
00:32:30,765 --> 00:32:34,700
And I gotta go recursive
again, to go get its operands.

777
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,401
I get the 5, that's good.

778
00:32:36,403 --> 00:32:41,072
I'm gonna go recursive again,
get the 6, over here.

779
00:32:41,074 --> 00:32:42,907
And I've evaluated the whole
stack.

780
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:45,876
So, you see how I have to keep
going backward recursively to

781
00:32:45,878 --> 00:32:46,576
my evaluate-

782
00:32:46,578 --> 00:32:47,911
>> [COUGH]

783
00:32:47,912 --> 00:32:49,245
>> To get the operands for my
operations.

784
00:32:49,247 --> 00:32:51,848
Once, I get to an operand I
can stop,

785
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,483
okay number, I got it and I'm
out of of there.

786
00:32:54,485 --> 00:32:56,418
But every time I encounter
another operation,

787
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,153
I have to keep going
recursively to

788
00:32:58,155 --> 00:33:00,822
get all my arguments, any
questions about that?

789
00:33:00,824 --> 00:33:06,327
'Kay, so it's actually gonna
be pretty simple recursion.

790
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:08,862
When you see the code, you're
gonna be, that makes sense.

791
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:12,832
So, I'm gonna have this
separate I'm gonna put this up

792
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:15,201
on top for scrolling reasons.

793
00:33:15,203 --> 00:33:18,237
Oops.
Didn't mean that.

794
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:19,672
The separate evaluate.

795
00:33:20,808 --> 00:33:25,677
And this evaluate is going to
take a stack of ops,

796
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,078
as its argument.

797
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,645
And why does it take a stack
of ops?

798
00:33:28,647 --> 00:33:31,048
Because as it's recursing,

799
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,882
it's using the rest of the
ops.

800
00:33:32,884 --> 00:33:34,050
So, you see what I mean?

801
00:33:34,052 --> 00:33:35,618
It's not,

802
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:37,185
it can't be looking at the big
opStack in our brain.

803
00:33:37,188 --> 00:33:38,320
It can't look at this.

804
00:33:38,322 --> 00:33:40,756
'Kay, cuz it's kind of
consuming it.

805
00:33:40,758 --> 00:33:42,991
Right?
And every time I call it

806
00:33:42,992 --> 00:33:45,225
recursively, I'm gonna get
fewer operands to work with.

807
00:33:45,228 --> 00:33:46,194
So this is what I'm doing.

808
00:33:46,196 --> 00:33:47,962
Now, the first time I call it,

809
00:33:47,964 --> 00:33:50,864
right here, I'm gonna give it
the full opStack.

810
00:33:50,866 --> 00:33:53,767
So, I'll call my recursive one
from here.

811
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:56,036
Now, what's this thing gonna
return?

812
00:33:56,038 --> 00:33:56,836
'Kay.

813
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:57,770
That's interesting and

814
00:33:57,772 --> 00:34:00,873
here's a big new thing for you
to see.

815
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:03,709
You've read about it I, I
can't remember I

816
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:05,910
even asked you to read about
this but I think I.

817
00:34:05,912 --> 00:34:06,811
No, I guess I didn't.

818
00:34:06,813 --> 00:34:08,846
Which is tuples, 'kay?

819
00:34:08,848 --> 00:34:14,484
So in Swift, you can combine
multiple things together

820
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:16,853
into one kind of really te,

821
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:19,922
mini data structure called a
tuple, 'kay?

822
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:22,124
Don't let the tu [LAUGH] sound
in there fool you.

823
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,560
It's not just two, it's any
number, okay?

824
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,762
And you just put them in a
parentheses, okay?

825
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,664
And, and that's it.

826
00:34:28,665 --> 00:34:30,565
So you can use this for return
values.

827
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:32,033
So I've gotta function right
here,

828
00:34:32,035 --> 00:34:34,735
and I actually need to return
two things from this evaluate.

829
00:34:35,771 --> 00:34:37,754
'Kay?
One thing I

830
00:34:37,755 --> 00:34:39,738
need to return is the result
of a evaluating it.

831
00:34:40,975 --> 00:34:43,042
But the other thing I

832
00:34:43,043 --> 00:34:45,110
need to return is the rest of
the stack that I didn't use.

833
00:34:45,112 --> 00:34:48,647
Cuz as I'm working my way down
here and I take off that

834
00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:52,884
times, and the 4 and the 5,
okay, I'm consuming things but

835
00:34:52,886 --> 00:34:54,652
then I'm leaving the rest of
the stacks, so

836
00:34:54,654 --> 00:34:56,920
I have to keep returning
what's left of the stacks,

837
00:34:56,922 --> 00:34:58,722
while we keep consuming it.

838
00:34:58,724 --> 00:34:59,689
Okay?

839
00:34:59,691 --> 00:35:01,958
So, I'm gonna return this in a
tuple.

840
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,126
Tuples could not be simpler
syntax,

841
00:35:04,128 --> 00:35:08,097
just open parentheses, not
nine, open parentheses.

842
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:11,066
Open parentheses, and just all
the types that you,

843
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:12,634
of things that you want in
here.

844
00:35:12,636 --> 00:35:14,569
So, I'm gonna return a double
question mark,

845
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,070
that's my results.

846
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,683
'Kay?

847
00:35:17,684 --> 00:35:19,295
That's what's eventually,
gonna be

848
00:35:19,296 --> 00:35:20,907
returned out here after all
the recursion unwinds.

849
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,643
And then also I'm going to

850
00:35:23,645 --> 00:35:28,348
have the ops that are left
over.

851
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:32,851
Now, a tuple could look just
like this, unnamed.

852
00:35:32,853 --> 00:35:34,519
Did you see how these things
are not named,

853
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:35,920
each of these things in here.

854
00:35:35,922 --> 00:35:38,956
But you can also put names in
here as, if you want, as well.

855
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:41,092
So maybe I would call this one
the result.

856
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:44,728
Okay?
And

857
00:35:44,729 --> 00:35:47,396
I would call this one
remainingOps, 'kay?

858
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:49,666
And I kinda recommend putting
those in there, and

859
00:35:49,668 --> 00:35:52,601
you'll see why in a second
because there's two ways to

860
00:35:52,603 --> 00:35:56,138
call a function that returns a
tuple and get the results.

861
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:00,208
And one of the ways requires
that you name these, 'kay?

862
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,843
So, it doesn't hurt to name
the, you might, as well.

863
00:36:01,845 --> 00:36:03,111
It's good documentation.

864
00:36:03,113 --> 00:36:05,379
Someone looking at this now
knows, oh, yeah,

865
00:36:05,381 --> 00:36:07,147
this is the result of the
evaluation, and

866
00:36:07,149 --> 00:36:09,783
these the ops that were left
over.

867
00:36:09,785 --> 00:36:10,784
'Kay?

868
00:36:10,786 --> 00:36:13,419
All right.

869
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,121
So let's dive in here.

870
00:36:15,123 --> 00:36:16,956
The first thing,

871
00:36:16,957 --> 00:36:18,790
line of code I'm gonna put in
this recursive function

872
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:21,193
is the failure line of code,

873
00:36:21,195 --> 00:36:25,930
which is return nil, ops,
okay?

874
00:36:25,932 --> 00:36:28,566
So if I fail, okay, I'm gonna
try and

875
00:36:28,568 --> 00:36:33,303
do my best in here to evaluate
these ops you passed me, but

876
00:36:33,305 --> 00:36:36,272
if I fail I'm just gonna
return my result of nil.

877
00:36:36,274 --> 00:36:37,974
'Kay?

878
00:36:37,975 --> 00:36:39,675
And that's gonna be my default
is to return nil so

879
00:36:39,678 --> 00:36:40,643
I know I failed.

880
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:42,344
So, if I run out of operands
or

881
00:36:42,346 --> 00:36:44,613
I run out of stack can't find
it for

882
00:36:44,615 --> 00:36:47,915
example, it's just gonna fall
out here and return nil.

883
00:36:49,152 --> 00:36:49,683
Okay?

884
00:36:49,685 --> 00:36:50,784
So that's good.

885
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:52,619
So, what do I need to do here?

886
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:56,089
Well, first thing is I need to
make sure I have some ops.

887
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:59,859
So I'm gonna check to see if
the ops is not empty.

888
00:36:59,861 --> 00:37:04,529
Okay, if you've handed me a
stack of no ops to evaluates,

889
00:37:04,531 --> 00:37:05,463
I can't do that.

890
00:37:05,465 --> 00:37:06,698
So I'm just gonna return nil.

891
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,615
'Kay?
So

892
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:08,531
that's the very first thing,

893
00:37:08,534 --> 00:37:11,035
I gotta make sure I have some
ops to work with.

894
00:37:11,037 --> 00:37:14,237
Now, I'm gonna grab the first
op of the stack, so

895
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:16,639
in this example, I'm gonna
grab that x off of here.

896
00:37:16,641 --> 00:37:17,206
'Kay?

897
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:18,574
I'm gonna do that,

898
00:37:18,576 --> 00:37:24,012
I'm gonna try to do that by
saying, let op equal ops.

899
00:37:24,014 --> 00:37:26,114
'Kay, ops is this argument,
right here.

900
00:37:26,116 --> 00:37:28,483
'Kay, that's the ops, you told
me to work on.

901
00:37:28,485 --> 00:37:31,519
And we know how to removeLast.

902
00:37:31,521 --> 00:37:33,687
Remember, removeLast from last
time?

903
00:37:33,689 --> 00:37:36,156
Removes the last thing off an
array.

904
00:37:36,158 --> 00:37:38,992
And when we are trying to make
an array look like a stack,

905
00:37:38,994 --> 00:37:40,594
that's how we do it, okay?

906
00:37:40,595 --> 00:37:42,195
We push things by putting
these on the end of the array.

907
00:37:42,197 --> 00:37:44,196
We pop things by, by pulling
it out.

908
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:45,431
But you can see I got an error
there.

909
00:37:45,433 --> 00:37:48,166
[BLANK_AUDIO]

910
00:37:48,168 --> 00:37:49,768
And it's very important to
understand why I

911
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,835
have an error here, okay?

912
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:53,704
So I'm gonna click on it.

913
00:37:53,706 --> 00:37:54,805
We're gonna read what it says,

914
00:37:54,807 --> 00:38:00,009
it says, immutable value of
type array of op,

915
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:04,113
only has a mutating member
named removeLast.

916
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,548
Okay, well this is kind of a
formal way of saying,

917
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:13,221
you can't do removeLast on ops
because ops is immutable.

918
00:38:13,223 --> 00:38:14,455
It's read-only.

919
00:38:14,457 --> 00:38:15,556
You cannot mutate it.

920
00:38:15,558 --> 00:38:16,990
You cannot change it.

921
00:38:16,992 --> 00:38:20,160
Okay, why is ops read-only?

922
00:38:20,162 --> 00:38:23,063
Well, there's two things to
think about here.

923
00:38:23,065 --> 00:38:26,899
One is, when you pass
arguments into functions,

924
00:38:26,901 --> 00:38:29,702
unless it's a class that
you're passing,

925
00:38:29,704 --> 00:38:32,137
unless you're passing an
instance of a class.

926
00:38:32,139 --> 00:38:34,172
The thing you pass is copied.

927
00:38:34,174 --> 00:38:35,791
'Kay?

928
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:37,409
It's very important to
understand that,

929
00:38:37,411 --> 00:38:38,876
that's passed by value.

930
00:38:38,878 --> 00:38:40,845
You're used to it in other
languages,

931
00:38:40,847 --> 00:38:43,313
most languages do this, pass
by value.

932
00:38:43,315 --> 00:38:46,516
Arrays and dictionaries are
not classes.

933
00:38:47,652 --> 00:38:49,952
They're not classes in Swift.

934
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:50,886
They're structs.

935
00:38:50,888 --> 00:38:52,754
You know, like a C struct?

936
00:38:52,756 --> 00:38:53,955
'Kay?

937
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,723
Arrays and dictionaries are
structs.

938
00:38:55,725 --> 00:38:58,759
Structs in Swift look a lot
like classes.

939
00:38:58,761 --> 00:39:00,594
They have functions,

940
00:39:00,595 --> 00:39:02,428
they can even have properties
that have storage.

941
00:39:02,431 --> 00:39:04,865
They're almost identical to a
class, really.

942
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:09,102
The only two huge differences
between structs and classes.

943
00:39:09,104 --> 00:39:12,638
One is that classes can have
inheritance.

944
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,274
And structs cannot, okay?

945
00:39:15,276 --> 00:39:20,745
But number two is that structs
are passed by value and

946
00:39:20,747 --> 00:39:25,049
classes are passed by
reference, okay?

947
00:39:25,051 --> 00:39:27,751
Very important that you
understand that distinction.

948
00:39:27,753 --> 00:39:30,687
So structs are usually only
used for basic.

949
00:39:30,689 --> 00:39:33,289
You know, components like
arrays and dictionaries.

950
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:37,159
Even doubles and ints are
structs in Swift, okay?

951
00:39:37,161 --> 00:39:38,627
>> [COUGH]

952
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:40,094
>> And that's great because
that means doubles and

953
00:39:40,097 --> 00:39:42,564
ints can have functions on
them and things like that,

954
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:44,599
which we will see as the
quarter goes by.

955
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:46,501
But those things are all
passed by values.

956
00:39:46,503 --> 00:39:48,669
So that's the first thing to
understand is that this ops,

957
00:39:48,671 --> 00:39:52,139
when I call evaluate, whatever
array of ops I pass to it,

958
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:53,840
it's gonna be copied.

959
00:39:53,842 --> 00:39:55,108
Okay?

960
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,643
The second thing to understand
here is that they're kind of

961
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:03,682
an implicit let in front of
all things you pass.

962
00:40:03,684 --> 00:40:05,484
In other words, they're
read-only.

963
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,651
Make sense?

964
00:40:06,653 --> 00:40:12,390
And a read-only array can't be
mutated.

965
00:40:12,392 --> 00:40:14,475
I can't append things to it.

966
00:40:14,476 --> 00:40:16,559
You can't remove things from
it cuz it's read-only.

967
00:40:16,562 --> 00:40:21,364
Now, I can actually put the
word var here, okay?

968
00:40:21,366 --> 00:40:22,999
If I, sorry.

969
00:40:23,001 --> 00:40:25,267
If I put the word var here,

970
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:29,204
then ops inside here look no
error.

971
00:40:29,206 --> 00:40:32,674
Ops is a mutable array.

972
00:40:32,676 --> 00:40:34,575
It's still a copy though.

973
00:40:34,577 --> 00:40:36,711
So they copied it, made it
mutable.

974
00:40:36,713 --> 00:40:41,381
And now inside here, I have a
mutable copy to work with.

975
00:40:41,383 --> 00:40:45,084
Now, I'm not a big fan of
doing that, 'kay?

976
00:40:45,086 --> 00:40:46,118
Putting var up here.

977
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,586
I think it's a little
confusing for

978
00:40:47,588 --> 00:40:49,221
readers of the code,

979
00:40:49,222 --> 00:40:50,855
to understand exactly what's
going on there.

980
00:40:50,858 --> 00:40:53,208
So, I'm not gonna do that,

981
00:40:53,209 --> 00:40:55,559
instead, I'm gonna make a
local variable here, which I'm

982
00:40:55,562 --> 00:41:00,865
gonna call remainingOps and
I'm gonna set it equal to ops.

983
00:41:00,867 --> 00:41:03,000
Now, when you set equals like
this,

984
00:41:04,103 --> 00:41:07,103
that copies it if it's not a
class.

985
00:41:07,105 --> 00:41:08,571
Classes are all by reference.

986
00:41:08,573 --> 00:41:09,438
It's exactly, what you would
think.

987
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,539
>> [COUGH].
>> But anything else,

988
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:12,808
strucks or enums or anything
else.

989
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:14,543
When you do equals here,

990
00:41:14,544 --> 00:41:16,277
this is actually going to make
a copy of this, and

991
00:41:16,279 --> 00:41:17,895
put it in here.

992
00:41:17,896 --> 00:41:19,512
And since it's a var, it's
going to be mutable.

993
00:41:21,584 --> 00:41:23,083
Okay?

994
00:41:23,084 --> 00:41:24,583
So now I have a mutable array
of opts and

995
00:41:24,586 --> 00:41:26,519
now I can say remainingOpts.

996
00:41:26,521 --> 00:41:27,854
Remove the last one.

997
00:41:27,856 --> 00:41:30,122
And now I truly do have the
remainingOpts.

998
00:41:30,124 --> 00:41:32,358
I've removed the first thing
in there.

999
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,594
[BLANK_AUDIO]

1000
00:41:35,596 --> 00:41:38,463
Did everyone understand that
little tidbit there?

1001
00:41:38,465 --> 00:41:39,464
Yeah?
>> So there's a,

1002
00:41:39,466 --> 00:41:42,800
like a, a unseen let in sort
of the opts?

1003
00:41:42,802 --> 00:41:43,600
>> Yeah.
>> Why isn't that like in

1004
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:47,371
front of doubles and

1005
00:41:47,373 --> 00:41:48,672
like ends or straightened
>> It is.

1006
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:50,873
So, the question is why is
there not a kind of unseen,

1007
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,508
let in front of all arguments?

1008
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,376
Pretty much all arguments to
functions kind of

1009
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:55,577
have that unseen let in there.

1010
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,545
They're all read on, 'kay?

1011
00:41:57,547 --> 00:41:59,681
So and you could put var in
front of any one and

1012
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,516
turn it into a mutable copy of
it,

1013
00:42:02,518 --> 00:42:03,484
that you could use locally.

1014
00:42:03,486 --> 00:42:04,885
But if you only use it
locally,

1015
00:42:04,887 --> 00:42:06,219
it's not that great a thing.

1016
00:42:06,221 --> 00:42:08,371
Okay?

1017
00:42:08,372 --> 00:42:10,522
Now, there is a way to have,
to pass by value things back

1018
00:42:10,525 --> 00:42:13,959
out, but I'm not even gonna
talk about that.

1019
00:42:13,961 --> 00:42:14,726
Okay.

1020
00:42:14,728 --> 00:42:16,027
You can read about it.

1021
00:42:16,029 --> 00:42:17,328
It's this in out thing.

1022
00:42:18,698 --> 00:42:20,665
I'm not even gonna talk about
it.

1023
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:22,633
I really think it's better to
stay within the value,

1024
00:42:22,635 --> 00:42:25,035
pass by value, pass by
reference parameters.

1025
00:42:25,037 --> 00:42:27,604
I think you can get more
readable code that way.

1026
00:42:27,606 --> 00:42:30,139
But there is a way, there is a
way I'm not going to talk

1027
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:33,075
about to do in out basically,
prime numbers that go in out.

1028
00:42:33,077 --> 00:42:33,842
Yeah.

1029
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:36,712
>> Is there any way to

1030
00:42:36,714 --> 00:42:39,180
[INAUDIBLE]

1031
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,949
>> Yeah that's what I just
said.

1032
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,717
There is a way to pass it kind
of by reference in out.

1033
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:44,618
You know, you pass it in, you
modify it,

1034
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,054
and then it'll come back out
when it's done at the end.

1035
00:42:47,056 --> 00:42:48,255
So, it's kind of like by
reference.

1036
00:42:49,224 --> 00:42:50,323
But the other thing you said
is,

1037
00:42:50,325 --> 00:42:52,558
oh this is terrible I'm making
three copies of

1038
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,394
that dang thing, this must be
super slow.

1039
00:42:55,396 --> 00:42:57,029
And the answer is no.

1040
00:42:57,031 --> 00:43:01,599
Swift is super smart about not
actually copying it,

1041
00:43:01,601 --> 00:43:04,135
until you actually make a
change to it.

1042
00:43:04,137 --> 00:43:07,271
So here when it passes a copy
in it didn't really

1043
00:43:07,273 --> 00:43:10,073
copy it, it just kinda passed
a pointer in but it knows that

1044
00:43:10,075 --> 00:43:13,576
pointer is by, you know, not
by reference it's by value.

1045
00:43:13,578 --> 00:43:15,611
And then when I copied it
again here.

1046
00:43:15,613 --> 00:43:17,146
It still didn't really copy
it.

1047
00:43:17,148 --> 00:43:19,081
Even if this array had 10,000
things in it,

1048
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:21,116
it didn't make 10,000 copy of
it.

1049
00:43:21,118 --> 00:43:25,019
It was only here where I
actually mutated,

1050
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:26,120
now it had to make a copy.

1051
00:43:26,122 --> 00:43:28,989
And it may not even have made
an entire copy.

1052
00:43:28,991 --> 00:43:32,025
It might have just kept track
of the changes, for example.

1053
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:33,860
So, it's super smart behind
the scenes.

1054
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:34,861
Sweet to very smart.

1055
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:36,862
So, don't worry too, about
much about oh,

1056
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,630
I'm copying these things over
and over.

1057
00:43:38,632 --> 00:43:40,332
Swift is making the minimum
out of

1058
00:43:40,334 --> 00:43:41,433
actual copying going on.

1059
00:43:41,435 --> 00:43:42,600
Okay?

1060
00:43:42,602 --> 00:43:47,171
All right, so now I have
remainingOpts here,

1061
00:43:47,173 --> 00:43:49,840
which truly are my remaining
opts.

1062
00:43:49,842 --> 00:43:51,842
'Kay.
Because I've

1063
00:43:51,843 --> 00:43:53,843
removed the top one, the x,
off the top.

1064
00:43:53,845 --> 00:43:56,279
So now I've got all the
remainingOps,

1065
00:43:56,281 --> 00:43:59,181
in this local variable here
called remainingOps.

1066
00:43:59,183 --> 00:44:00,566
Okay.

1067
00:44:00,567 --> 00:44:01,950
Now, what am I gonna do with
this op that I pulled off,

1068
00:44:01,952 --> 00:44:03,218
this one on the top, x?

1069
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:06,621
Well I'm gonna get the
associated value from

1070
00:44:06,623 --> 00:44:07,888
the enum.

1071
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:11,792
'Kay.
Either this or these or this.

1072
00:44:11,794 --> 00:44:13,226
And how do I do that?

1073
00:44:13,228 --> 00:44:15,094
I use Switch.

1074
00:44:15,096 --> 00:44:17,496
'Kay, I told you that Switch
is really important.

1075
00:44:17,498 --> 00:44:20,032
And now you're seeing that
Switch is really important.

1076
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:21,867
Switch is how you pull things
out,

1077
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:23,668
associated values out of
enums.

1078
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,036
So I'm just gonna switch on
the op.

1079
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:27,772
'Kay, this is the op that I
pulled off the top,

1080
00:44:27,774 --> 00:44:30,708
that x from the thing we did
on the board.

1081
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,109
And I'm just gonna look at the
cases, so

1082
00:44:32,111 --> 00:44:35,412
I have the case operand, okay.

1083
00:44:35,414 --> 00:44:38,581
Notice that it puts a little
dot here because it's

1084
00:44:38,583 --> 00:44:41,450
really Op.Operand and it's
using type inference to

1085
00:44:41,452 --> 00:44:43,652
know that it's Op.Operand,
right.

1086
00:44:43,654 --> 00:44:47,289
Op.op, Op.Operand but it
doesn't need the op there.

1087
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:50,892
And here it's asking in this
space, what do you wanna do

1088
00:44:50,894 --> 00:44:54,628
with the associated value if
you're handling this case.

1089
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:56,864
Where the enum is operand.

1090
00:44:56,866 --> 00:44:58,432
'Kay?

1091
00:44:58,434 --> 00:45:04,037
Well I want to let that
associated value

1092
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:10,175
be assigned to a constant
called operand.

1093
00:45:10,177 --> 00:45:11,510
'Kay?

1094
00:45:11,512 --> 00:45:14,746
And yes I could put var here,
which would do the same thing,

1095
00:45:14,748 --> 00:45:17,715
except for I could then change
the thing in here.

1096
00:45:17,717 --> 00:45:20,685
But I almost never wanna do
this, almost always let.

1097
00:45:20,687 --> 00:45:23,887
So let operand means that
inside the handling of

1098
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:27,157
this case, 'kay, this case of
the switch.

1099
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:30,693
Inside here, operand is gonna
have the associated value of

1100
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:31,427
the operand.

1101
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,196
'Kay?

1102
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:35,897
Oh, that's exactly what I
want.

1103
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,599
I'm just gonna return right
now I have to return this

1104
00:45:38,601 --> 00:45:40,301
tuple right here.

1105
00:45:40,303 --> 00:45:42,569
So I'm gonna returned the
operand.

1106
00:45:42,571 --> 00:45:45,005
That's the result, 'kay.

1107
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:47,191
When I go here and

1108
00:45:47,192 --> 00:45:49,376
I encounter that next one down
which was a four, I got a four

1109
00:45:49,378 --> 00:45:52,845
I can just return that result
to evaluate this one.

1110
00:45:52,847 --> 00:45:55,881
And I also though have to
return the remainingOps.

1111
00:45:57,018 --> 00:46:00,085
'Kay, so I'm just returning
the two values of this tuple,

1112
00:46:00,087 --> 00:46:02,754
notice I don't have to put
result colon and

1113
00:46:02,756 --> 00:46:06,390
remaining opt colon in here it
knows that those match and

1114
00:46:06,392 --> 00:46:07,224
so it's still doing it.

1115
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:09,159
All right, makes sense.

1116
00:46:09,161 --> 00:46:13,763
That's it for operand that's
all I have to do.

1117
00:46:13,765 --> 00:46:15,064
It's kind of a, in the
recursion,

1118
00:46:15,066 --> 00:46:20,102
it's kind of an end case.

1119
00:46:20,104 --> 00:46:21,069
Yeah?
>> Is remainingOps part of

1120
00:46:21,071 --> 00:46:22,520
the stack or heap?

1121
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:23,970
>> This one here, or this one
here?

1122
00:46:23,973 --> 00:46:24,989
>> What in general
[INAUDIBLE].

1123
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,006
>> Okay so, so the question
is,

1124
00:46:26,009 --> 00:46:29,276
when I do something like this,
where is remainingOps?

1125
00:46:29,278 --> 00:46:30,377
Is it in the heap?

1126
00:46:30,379 --> 00:46:31,812
Is it on the stack?

1127
00:46:31,813 --> 00:46:33,246
And the thing is, that's
implementation detail.

1128
00:46:34,282 --> 00:46:36,148
So, you, you don't know, but
you don't care.

1129
00:46:38,018 --> 00:46:40,185
All right, so that's operand.

1130
00:46:40,187 --> 00:46:42,020
Operand was really, really
easy.

1131
00:46:42,022 --> 00:46:44,321
How about our operation,
that's you, you,

1132
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:46,090
UnaryOperation right here.

1133
00:46:46,092 --> 00:46:49,659
Now when we handle the case of
the unary operation,

1134
00:46:49,661 --> 00:46:52,195
we don't need that first
associated value,

1135
00:46:52,197 --> 00:46:54,330
that's the symbol, like plus.

1136
00:46:54,332 --> 00:46:56,332
Okay well I'm evaluating here
I don't care what this

1137
00:46:56,334 --> 00:46:58,500
symbol is, I only care what
the function is cause I'm

1138
00:46:58,502 --> 00:47:00,002
gonna evaluate the function.

1139
00:47:00,004 --> 00:47:05,807
So we can actually ignore this
by putting in underbar, 'kay?

1140
00:47:05,809 --> 00:47:08,642
Underbar in swift is kind of

1141
00:47:08,644 --> 00:47:12,212
the universal I don't care
about this thing.

1142
00:47:12,214 --> 00:47:14,681
Okay and we're gonna see it
other places we use it

1143
00:47:14,683 --> 00:47:16,549
where it's kinda like, I don't
really care about that.

1144
00:47:16,551 --> 00:47:18,251
So you just put an underbar
there.

1145
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:19,819
That way you don't have to
declare a variable with

1146
00:47:19,821 --> 00:47:22,221
some dumb name or something
like that.

1147
00:47:22,223 --> 00:47:24,389
Just put an underbar it
ignores it.

1148
00:47:24,391 --> 00:47:25,323
'Kay?

1149
00:47:25,324 --> 00:47:26,256
But I do care about this.

1150
00:47:26,259 --> 00:47:29,794
I'm gonna let that equal the
operation that I'm doing.

1151
00:47:29,796 --> 00:47:30,361
'Kay?

1152
00:47:31,397 --> 00:47:32,929
Everyone, make sense there?

1153
00:47:32,931 --> 00:47:34,897
So I'm ignoring the string,
but

1154
00:47:34,899 --> 00:47:36,699
I'm grabbing the operation.

1155
00:47:36,701 --> 00:47:40,402
So here, what I wanna do is
return and I'll try to do it,

1156
00:47:40,404 --> 00:47:41,370
but I'm not gonna be able to.

1157
00:47:41,372 --> 00:47:45,540
I'm gonna say, return this
operation with

1158
00:47:45,542 --> 00:47:48,342
its operand which I don't
have.

1159
00:47:48,344 --> 00:47:51,512
And there's some remaining ops
that are leftover after I

1160
00:47:51,514 --> 00:47:52,579
get the operand.

1161
00:47:52,581 --> 00:47:55,515
So I'm kinda, I need to do
some stuff here to

1162
00:47:55,517 --> 00:47:58,251
be able to return what I want.

1163
00:47:58,253 --> 00:48:01,053
The first thing I need to do
is get the operand.

1164
00:48:01,055 --> 00:48:03,689
'Kay?

1165
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,324
So, I did a unary operation
let's say it was square root.

1166
00:48:06,326 --> 00:48:07,625
I need to go back to the staff
and

1167
00:48:07,627 --> 00:48:10,862
pick off the next thing but I
can't just

1168
00:48:10,864 --> 00:48:13,931
assume that it's a number it
might be more operations so

1169
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:17,001
I have to recurse, so here's
where the recursion comes in.

1170
00:48:17,003 --> 00:48:20,103
And I'm gonna show you how to
call a function that

1171
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,172
returns a tuple.

1172
00:48:22,174 --> 00:48:25,274
And get it's value up so this
is important little example

1173
00:48:25,276 --> 00:48:27,677
here, so there's two ways to
do it.

1174
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:30,279
I'm gonna do it one way here,
which is,

1175
00:48:30,281 --> 00:48:32,881
I'm gonna let
operandEvaluation,

1176
00:48:32,883 --> 00:48:37,919
which is just a local variable
that I'm inventing, equal call

1177
00:48:37,921 --> 00:48:43,057
evaluate with the remainingOps
that I have.

1178
00:48:43,059 --> 00:48:45,025
'Kay, so here I've recursed.

1179
00:48:45,027 --> 00:48:46,459
Okay, I'm recursing.

1180
00:48:46,461 --> 00:48:48,661
And I just set it to
operandEvaluation.

1181
00:48:48,663 --> 00:48:51,564
Now, let's look at the type of
this thing.

1182
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:55,300
If I look at its type, you can
see that it's a tuple.

1183
00:48:55,302 --> 00:48:56,468
That's its type.

1184
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:58,770
It's a tuple result
remainingOps.

1185
00:48:58,772 --> 00:49:00,671
It's this tuple right here.

1186
00:49:00,673 --> 00:49:03,140
That is the type of this
operandEvaluation.

1187
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:06,242
So now that I have that tuple,

1188
00:49:06,244 --> 00:49:09,245
it's the result of evaluation
how do I get the result and

1189
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:13,716
the remaining op out of it
well I can get the operand by

1190
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:19,621
saying operand eval, [UNKNOWN]
operandEvaluation.result.

1191
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,423
'Kay?

1192
00:49:21,424 --> 00:49:23,224
So that just pull this is the
tuple here I'm

1193
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:26,227
getting this value of the
tuple out of there.

1194
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:27,461
Now what type is this?

1195
00:49:29,298 --> 00:49:29,863
Anybody?

1196
00:49:30,865 --> 00:49:31,931
It's an optional.

1197
00:49:31,932 --> 00:49:32,998
You're pretty safe saying
optional when I

1198
00:49:33,001 --> 00:49:34,099
ask what type it is, aren't
you?

1199
00:49:34,101 --> 00:49:35,801
It's almost always an
optional.

1200
00:49:35,803 --> 00:49:37,168
Cuz I usually don't ask if
it's not.

1201
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:40,672
But it is indeed an optional,
an optional double.

1202
00:49:40,674 --> 00:49:42,707
It's this type right here,
okay?

1203
00:49:42,709 --> 00:49:46,043
So we need to turn it into a
double if we're gonna pass it

1204
00:49:46,045 --> 00:49:48,078
to this operation right here.

1205
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:52,648
So I'm gonna use if let to
turn that into a double.

1206
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:55,084
'Kay?

1207
00:49:55,085 --> 00:49:57,519
Now, I can actually do this
because I have the operand.

1208
00:49:57,521 --> 00:49:58,587
Just got it right here.

1209
00:49:58,589 --> 00:50:00,755
'Kay?
This is now a double, see?

1210
00:50:00,757 --> 00:50:04,125
And I can call this operation
right here.

1211
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:06,327
And this is the remaining ops,
but this has got to

1212
00:50:06,329 --> 00:50:09,229
be the remaining ops after we
recursed.

1213
00:50:09,231 --> 00:50:13,233
So it's gotta be the remaining
ops in this operandEvaluation.

1214
00:50:13,235 --> 00:50:15,368
So that
operandEvaluation.remaining-

1215
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:19,471
Ops.
Everybody cool with that?

1216
00:50:19,473 --> 00:50:21,206
So that's it.

1217
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:25,343
It's just recurse, we just
recursed to evaluate that.

1218
00:50:25,345 --> 00:50:29,180
If this fails if, if this
recursion returned nil,

1219
00:50:29,182 --> 00:50:31,849
then this is, this, if let's
not gonna happen this

1220
00:50:31,851 --> 00:50:34,584
return's not gonna happen,
gonna fall all the way out and

1221
00:50:34,586 --> 00:50:37,454
return nill which is what we
want, 'kay.

1222
00:50:37,456 --> 00:50:39,522
We failed in any of our
recursive attempts to

1223
00:50:39,524 --> 00:50:40,756
get the operands we need,

1224
00:50:40,758 --> 00:50:42,825
we gotta fail all the way up
to the top level.

1225
00:50:42,827 --> 00:50:46,028
[BLANK_AUDIO]

1226
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:48,063
Okay now binary operation.

1227
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:52,466
Also okay, let's do yeah,
binary here case.

1228
00:50:53,535 --> 00:50:54,267
Binary.

1229
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:57,570
Obviously same exact thing
here.

1230
00:50:57,572 --> 00:50:59,438
We don't care about that.

1231
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,906
And here we're gonna let
operation.

1232
00:51:00,908 --> 00:51:03,708
And we're gonna do the exactly
the same thing we did

1233
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:06,577
here but we just have to do it
twice because we have two

1234
00:51:06,579 --> 00:51:08,646
operands to do here, through
here.

1235
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:15,052
So let's let opp1Evaluation =
evaluate(remainingOps).

1236
00:51:16,088 --> 00:51:17,487
'Kay.

1237
00:51:17,488 --> 00:51:18,887
And then if we can let
operand1 =

1238
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:20,756
op1Evaluation.result.

1239
00:51:20,758 --> 00:51:23,625
'Kay, then we got op1, that's
good.

1240
00:51:23,627 --> 00:51:27,262
So now let's let op2Evaluation
=

1241
00:51:27,264 --> 00:51:32,600
evaluation(op1Evaluation.rema-
iningOps).

1242
00:51:32,602 --> 00:51:36,370
'Kay?

1243
00:51:36,371 --> 00:51:40,139
And if we can let operand,
oops, if we can let operand2

1244
00:51:40,142 --> 00:51:44,844
= op2Evaluation.result, then
we can

1245
00:51:44,846 --> 00:51:50,716
return (operation(operand1,
operand2).

1246
00:51:50,718 --> 00:51:53,185

we'll have
op2Evaluation.remainingOps) as

1248
00:51:55,656 --> 00:51:57,355
our remaining ops.

1249
00:51:57,357 --> 00:52:00,825
Okay?
[BLANK_AUDIO]

1250
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:01,692

00:52:01,694 --> 00:52:02,426
All right.
What's our.

1252
00:52:02,428 --> 00:52:03,159

What is it?

1254
00:52:04,562 --> 00:52:05,695
okay.
Yeah,

1255
00:52:05,696 --> 00:52:06,829
this is a good error to cover
here.

1256
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:09,665
See this it says method must
be declared private because

1257
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:12,501
this parameter uses a private
value.

1258
00:52:12,503 --> 00:52:16,137
And sure enough op is private
so this has to be private.

1259
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,273
'Kay?

1260
00:52:20,476 --> 00:52:21,875
Now notice by the way,

1261
00:52:21,877 --> 00:52:28,080
I don't have default: break
here in this switch.

1262
00:52:28,082 --> 00:52:30,215
And why do I not have that?

1263
00:52:30,217 --> 00:52:33,418
Because I've handled every
possible value of op.

1264
00:52:35,088 --> 00:52:35,986
'Kay?
There are only

1265
00:52:35,988 --> 00:52:37,254
three kinds of op.

1266
00:52:37,256 --> 00:52:38,522
I've handled them all.

1267
00:52:38,524 --> 00:52:40,374
So I don't need any default.

1268
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:42,225
It wasn't like in the other
one where we had a string and

1269
00:52:42,227 --> 00:52:44,761
we only handle a few strings,
we had a default break.

1270
00:52:44,763 --> 00:52:47,863
You don't put default break in
when you handle every thing.

1271
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:49,598
And it's really bad programing
style to

1272
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,633
put a default break in every
single switch.

1273
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:54,903
'Kay, you should only put them
in on the ones where you

1274
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:58,373
truly are breaking because you
can't handle every case.

1275
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,574
'Kay?
All right.

1276
00:53:00,576 --> 00:53:03,844
Now, the last thing we have to
do is just call this recursive

1277
00:53:03,846 --> 00:53:06,113
version from here.

1278
00:53:06,115 --> 00:53:08,782
And I'm gonna call this one
and

1279
00:53:08,784 --> 00:53:11,117
get these tuple values a
little differently.

1280
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,718
I'm not gonna call it in the
same way here.

1281
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,920
I'm not gonna say, let
something equal.

1282
00:53:14,922 --> 00:53:20,091
Instead I'm gonna say let a
tuple which has let's call it

1283
00:53:20,093 --> 00:53:24,062
say (result, remainder) =
evaluate and

1284
00:53:24,064 --> 00:53:28,666
I'm gonna pass my whole
(opStack) here, okay.

1285
00:53:28,668 --> 00:53:31,668
So this is a different way to
call a function that returns

1286
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:35,305
a tuple here you actually let
a tuple equal the result.

1287
00:53:35,307 --> 00:53:37,974
Instead of letting a single
thing equal result and

1288
00:53:37,976 --> 00:53:42,111
then using the dots to get it,
you let the tuple equal it and

1289
00:53:42,113 --> 00:53:45,547
notice that these names don't
have to be the same as these

1290
00:53:45,549 --> 00:53:48,283
names so result is the same,
but here I

1291
00:53:48,285 --> 00:53:52,286
use the word remainder instead
of the word remainingOps.

1292
00:53:52,288 --> 00:53:53,754
Okay they do not have to be
the same.

1293
00:53:55,024 --> 00:54:00,694
And then here we just return
our result.

1294
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,261
Okay?

1295
00:54:02,263 --> 00:54:04,163
So we learned a lot right
there, okay.

1296
00:54:04,165 --> 00:54:05,297
We learned about tuple,

1297
00:54:05,299 --> 00:54:08,033
passing you know things back
tuples in

1298
00:54:08,035 --> 00:54:13,237
different ways you know how to
ignore things in enums and

1299
00:54:13,239 --> 00:54:15,106
when we're getting associate
values all that stuff.

1300
00:54:15,108 --> 00:54:16,974
So hopefully, you got all
that.

1301
00:54:16,976 --> 00:54:19,676
I see a few people still kinda
catching up on their typing.

1302
00:54:19,678 --> 00:54:21,444

00:54:27,285 --> 00:54:28,384
our calculator brain.

1306
00:54:28,386 --> 00:54:30,919
It wasn't really that bad
actually, right?

Pretty simple little data
structure here.

00:54:33,724 --> 00:54:36,858
Just have to say what our
known ops are.

you know,

powerful code.

If you're not comfortable with
your recursion I

1312
00:54:44,033 --> 00:54:46,533
can see how it might be a
little bit disturbing.

1313
00:54:46,535 --> 00:54:48,301
But go stare at it for

1314
00:54:48,302 --> 00:54:50,068
awhile and you'll, you'll get
it, how it works.

1325
00:55:10,622 --> 00:55:13,255
I only put that remainder
there to show you could have

00:55:13,257 --> 00:55:15,257
a different name, but I'm not
using the remainder.

>> Yes, the op stack will be

1331
00:55:25,017 --> 00:55:27,201
unaffected by this because op
stack is an array.

1332
00:55:27,203 --> 00:55:28,702
Arrays are passed by value so

1333
00:55:28,704 --> 00:55:30,837
a copy of it gets passed into
here.

1334
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:33,506
So this would be untouched and
which is what I want.

1335
00:55:33,508 --> 00:55:36,242
I don't want evaluate to
consume my op stack.

1336
00:55:36,244 --> 00:55:38,010
I wanna be able to call
evaluate over and

1337
00:55:38,012 --> 00:55:38,744
over and over.

1338
00:55:38,746 --> 00:55:39,945
'Kay?
Especially if,

1339
00:55:39,947 --> 00:55:43,581
I let's say introduced
variable operands and

1340
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:45,550
that's what you're homeworks
gonna be, then I wouldn't

1341
00:55:45,552 --> 00:55:47,685
want to change the variables
to different things and

1342
00:55:47,687 --> 00:55:49,520
be calling it over and

1343
00:55:49,521 --> 00:55:51,354
over with different values for
the variable for example and

1344
00:55:51,357 --> 00:55:53,690
then maybe next week I can
have an assignment where I'm

1345
00:55:53,692 --> 00:55:57,894
gonna make your graph such a
thing, which I'm going to do.

1346
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,012
Okay?

1347
00:55:59,013 --> 00:56:00,129
So that's why I wanna do that.

1348
00:56:00,131 --> 00:56:02,131
So anyway, yeah, remainder
here can just be anything.

1349
00:56:02,133 --> 00:56:03,532
I'm actually gonna put this
here because we're

1350
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:05,300
gonna print one this in a
second just so

1351
00:56:05,302 --> 00:56:06,567
we can get a better look at
what's going on.

1352
00:56:06,569 --> 00:56:10,904
But first, let's go back to
our controller and use this

1353
00:56:10,906 --> 00:56:14,007
calculator brain, this nice
model we just invented.

1354
00:56:14,009 --> 00:56:15,842
Let's use it.
Now,

1355
00:56:15,843 --> 00:56:17,676
I'm gonna show you how to get
two things on screen at

1356
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:18,644
the same time.

1357
00:56:18,646 --> 00:56:20,880
That aren't necessarily
directly related.

1358
00:56:20,882 --> 00:56:23,549
Before we have the story board
and then I went up and

1359
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,784
clicked this system editor
right here and

1360
00:56:25,786 --> 00:56:27,319
it showed me the controller.

1361
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,853
Because the system editor
figured out that, oh,

1362
00:56:28,855 --> 00:56:30,388
if you have the story board up
you probably want

1363
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:33,257
the controller for the scene
you have selected.

1364
00:56:33,259 --> 00:56:34,992
But here it's like, I don't
know what to show you.

1365
00:56:34,994 --> 00:56:36,827
So I'm gonna show you a
different way to

1366
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:39,229
get something in here, two
ways actually.

1367
00:56:39,231 --> 00:56:41,931
One is if you go to this top
bar where

1368
00:56:41,933 --> 00:56:44,667
it says counterparts, you can
mouse down and

1369
00:56:44,669 --> 00:56:47,603
you can find all kinds of
things about this

1370
00:56:47,605 --> 00:56:50,272
like subclasses of this class
on the left.

1371
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:54,642
Superclasses of this [UNKNOWN]
class on the left.

1372
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:57,111
Of course it has no
superclasses or subclasses.

1373
00:56:57,113 --> 00:57:00,547
But other things, things it
includes are included by it.

1374
00:57:00,549 --> 00:57:02,115
You can also just manually go
in.

1375
00:57:02,117 --> 00:57:03,283
We can go over here for
example and

1376
00:57:03,285 --> 00:57:06,152
find our view controller and
load it up that way, but

1377
00:57:06,154 --> 00:57:09,088
I'm gonna show you a different
way than doing that

1378
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:11,423
which is to go over here to
your navigator.

1379
00:57:11,425 --> 00:57:14,893
If you hold down Option and
press on

1380
00:57:14,895 --> 00:57:18,663
a file like ViewController it
will appear on the right.

1381
00:57:18,665 --> 00:57:20,464
'Kay?

1382
00:57:20,466 --> 00:57:22,866
So Option clicking in here is
another good way to

1383
00:57:22,868 --> 00:57:23,767
put things on the right.

1384
00:57:25,437 --> 00:57:27,320
Okay?

1385
00:57:27,321 --> 00:57:29,204
So now here we have our
calculator brain on the left

1386
00:57:29,207 --> 00:57:31,040
and we have our controller on
the right,

1387
00:57:31,042 --> 00:57:34,943
we are going to rip out all of
the stuff in our

1388
00:57:34,945 --> 00:57:39,180
controller that had to do with
being calculator.

1389
00:57:39,182 --> 00:57:41,716
Okay, so that's all this stuff
right in here.

1390
00:57:41,718 --> 00:57:43,484
'Kay.

1391
00:57:43,485 --> 00:57:45,251
All this calculating stuff, we
don't need any of this

1392
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:47,254
because those were only called
from there.

1393
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:49,022
'Kay, so our controller's
getting quite simple,

1394
00:57:49,024 --> 00:57:50,757
our controller hardly has
anything left in it.

1395
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:54,727
And that's because the UI only
needs this to be controlled.

1396
00:57:54,729 --> 00:57:56,579
'Kay?

1397
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:58,430
We also don't need our operand
stack because the brain is

1398
00:57:58,432 --> 00:58:00,766
gonna do that.

1399
00:58:00,767 --> 00:58:03,101
However, we do need a new
instance variable here

1400
00:58:03,103 --> 00:58:04,903
which is the calculator brain.

1401
00:58:05,905 --> 00:58:07,838
Okay I'm just gonna create one
like that,

1402
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:12,676
this is extremely common okay
this is

1403
00:58:12,678 --> 00:58:16,680
the green arrow that goes from
the controller to the model.

1404
00:58:16,682 --> 00:58:18,948
Remember that in our MVC talk
that I did last time I

1405
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:21,584
said that the controller has a
green arrow to the model,

1406
00:58:21,586 --> 00:58:24,386
it can talk to it all at once,
say anything it wants.

1407
00:58:24,388 --> 00:58:26,922
This is essentially that green
arrow.

1408
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:29,591
This is our model right here.

1409
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:31,592
And this is the controller
this is how the controller

1410
00:58:31,594 --> 00:58:33,661
talks to it through this thing
we call the brain.

1411
00:58:33,663 --> 00:58:35,562
Thing you can call it anything
you want and

1412
00:58:35,564 --> 00:58:38,298
of course this might be much
more complicated green arrow,

1413
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,767
it might be a network database
that is connecting to you to

1414
00:58:40,769 --> 00:58:41,934
get the data.

1415
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:43,102
Okay?

1416
00:58:43,104 --> 00:58:45,671
But in our case it's this very
simple little brain.

1417
00:58:45,673 --> 00:58:47,206
Okay.

1418
00:58:47,207 --> 00:58:48,740
So now we don't need this
either down here.

1419
00:58:48,742 --> 00:58:51,343
This is where we're appending
onto the op stack and

1420
00:58:51,345 --> 00:58:52,044
printing it out.

1421
00:58:52,045 --> 00:58:52,744
So we don't need that.

1422
00:58:52,746 --> 00:58:57,548
But we do need an enter to
push the operand onto

1423
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:58,615
the stack.

1424
00:58:59,718 --> 00:59:00,516
Okay.

1425
00:59:00,518 --> 00:59:03,519
So here I'm just gonna say,

1426
00:59:03,521 --> 00:59:08,657
that I'm gonna say I'm just
gonna

1427
00:59:08,659 --> 00:59:13,561
say brain.pushOperand(display)
value.

1428
00:59:13,563 --> 00:59:15,413
'Kay?

1429
00:59:15,414 --> 00:59:17,264
That's the main thing I need
to do, is just do that.

1430
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:21,902
One thing though is, I also
need to update my display.

1431
00:59:21,904 --> 00:59:23,870
Because when I push this
operand,

1432
00:59:23,872 --> 00:59:25,672
that's gonna change the brain.

1433
00:59:25,674 --> 00:59:28,341
I need to call that evaluate,
right?

1434
00:59:28,343 --> 00:59:29,442
And get the value.

1435
00:59:29,443 --> 00:59:30,542
So I could call evaluate here,
but

1436
00:59:30,544 --> 00:59:34,613
actually, I'm gonna go back to
my brain, and I'm gonna change

1437
00:59:34,615 --> 00:59:39,484
pushOperand to return the va,
the result of evaluating.

1438
00:59:39,486 --> 00:59:42,486
Typing today.

1439
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:46,623
From it, from its, from
internally, so

1440
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:48,991
I'm gonna return evaluate
here.

1441
00:59:48,993 --> 00:59:50,593
So that every time you push an
operand,

1442
00:59:50,595 --> 00:59:52,127
it'll just return the
evaluation.

1443
00:59:52,129 --> 00:59:55,163
Now one could argue whether
this is the best thing to do.

1444
00:59:55,165 --> 00:59:57,932
Because, you know, you might
not be interested in

1445
00:59:57,934 --> 01:00:00,568
the result of evaluating that
right now.

1446
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:03,671
But it kind of feels to me
kind of good.

1447
01:00:03,673 --> 01:00:05,339
And it's not gonna be,

1448
01:00:05,341 --> 01:00:07,341
there's not gonna be that many
things on the stack.

1449
01:00:07,343 --> 01:00:10,143
You're not gonna usually have
calculator brain

1450
01:00:10,145 --> 01:00:12,712
have 1,000 operations and
operands, although you could.

1451
01:00:12,714 --> 01:00:14,013
But you're not usually going
to so

1452
01:00:14,015 --> 01:00:16,548
it's probably not a
performance issue.

1453
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:19,751
To have it just return this
and it'll make caller's code,

1454
01:00:19,753 --> 01:00:22,320
you know, look a little
simpler.

1455
01:00:22,322 --> 01:00:24,522
And if they don't want this
return value,

1456
01:00:25,858 --> 01:00:27,808
then they can just ignore it.

1457
01:00:27,809 --> 01:00:29,759
They don't have to use it but
I am gonna use it.

1458
01:00:29,762 --> 01:00:31,495
So, when I push this operand
right here,

1459
01:00:31,497 --> 01:00:35,798
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna if
let the results equal that.

1460
01:00:36,734 --> 01:00:38,000
Okay, because it's an
optional.

1461
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:41,836
And if it's not nil then I'm
gonna

1462
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:43,671
set the display value to the
result.

1463
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:46,140
So in other words, every time
I push an operand,

1464
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:49,343
I'm gonna up my display value
with the evaluation.

1465
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:50,811
Make sense?

1466
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,446
Okay, what if this comes back
nil?

1467
01:00:54,982 --> 01:00:56,615
So, I push something on,

1468
01:00:56,617 --> 01:00:59,151
this is not gonna happen
probably with Push Operand,

1469
01:00:59,153 --> 01:01:02,587
but it might, and after your
homework it might.

1470
01:01:02,589 --> 01:01:04,022
So, what if I push and it
comes back nil?

1471
01:01:04,024 --> 01:01:07,258
Well, now I'm kinda stuck,
okay?

1472
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,728
This is why, in your homework
assignment, I suggested, wow

1473
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:13,730
wouldn't it be cool if display
value took an optional.

1474
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,600
Right, if display value took
and returned an optional.

1475
01:01:17,602 --> 01:01:20,769
You could put something
sensible in the display when

1476
01:01:20,771 --> 01:01:23,605
you had something that
couldn't be evaluated.

1477
01:01:23,607 --> 01:01:25,874
So in assignment two making
display value into

1478
01:01:25,876 --> 01:01:27,809
an optional is gonna be
required task.

1479
01:01:27,811 --> 01:01:29,977
So you might as well do it for
homework one,

1480
01:01:29,979 --> 01:01:33,447
cuz you're gonna have to do it
for homework two anyway.

1481
01:01:33,449 --> 01:01:35,182
Okay.

1482
01:01:35,183 --> 01:01:36,916
Just wanted to give you more
time because I didn't

1483
01:01:36,917 --> 01:01:38,650
really teach you the things
about NumberFormatter and

1484
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,320
stuff in time for assignment
one.

1485
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:44,623
But it's going to be required
and that's because the best I

1486
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:48,093
can do here is maybe say
display value equals zero.

1487
01:01:48,095 --> 01:01:50,962
That's really lame but that's
the best I can do.

1488
01:01:50,964 --> 01:01:54,432
I really wanna say, display
value was nil, okay.

1489
01:01:54,434 --> 01:01:56,634
I really just wanna set
display value equal to

1490
01:01:56,636 --> 01:01:58,953
the result of this.

1491
01:01:58,954 --> 01:02:01,271
And I wanna have nil, you
know, clear out my display or

1492
01:02:01,274 --> 01:02:02,606
in assignment two,

1493
01:02:02,608 --> 01:02:06,743
extra credit, maybe it puts an
error message in my display.

1494
01:02:07,912 --> 01:02:09,545
Now that's extra credit, but

1495
01:02:09,547 --> 01:02:11,246
that would be an even better
thing to put there.

1496
01:02:12,216 --> 01:02:14,216
Okay?

1497
01:02:14,217 --> 01:02:16,217
But same thing for, for
forming the operation.

1498
01:02:16,219 --> 01:02:17,652
Here's our operation right
here.

1499
01:02:17,654 --> 01:02:21,005
And I'm just gonna say,

1500
01:02:21,006 --> 01:02:24,357
if I can let the result equal
brains perform operation of

1501
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,361
the operation that I got off
the button, then I'm going to

1502
01:02:27,363 --> 01:02:29,963
let my display value equal
that result.

1503
01:02:31,366 --> 01:02:34,667
Otherwise I'm going to do the
very lame thing of

1504
01:02:34,669 --> 01:02:38,904
saying display value equals,
whoops, value equals zero.

1505
01:02:38,906 --> 01:02:40,389
Okay?
Unders,

1506
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:41,873
people understand why that's
kind of lame?

1507
01:02:41,875 --> 01:02:43,240
All right.

1508
01:02:45,644 --> 01:02:47,077
Okay.

1509
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:48,144
So that's it.

1510
01:02:48,146 --> 01:02:49,812
Look at how simple our
controller is here.

1511
01:02:49,814 --> 01:02:52,481
It has almost no code in it,
okay.

1512
01:02:52,483 --> 01:02:54,550
And that's really iOS is great
about that.

1513
01:02:54,552 --> 01:02:56,885
It really is pretty good about
making it so

1514
01:02:56,887 --> 01:02:58,920
that you can build your UI
mostly graphically so

1515
01:02:58,922 --> 01:03:01,923
that there's very little code
to control what's going on.

1516
01:03:01,925 --> 01:03:03,491
And then even our model,

1517
01:03:03,493 --> 01:03:05,759
which is a pretty powerful
calculator right now,

1518
01:03:05,761 --> 01:03:07,961
we could add as many functions
as we wanted to.

1519
01:03:07,963 --> 01:03:09,963
It's just one liners here.

1520
01:03:09,965 --> 01:03:13,766
And it would be capable of,
you know, evaluating any se,

1521
01:03:13,768 --> 01:03:15,334
series of them that's
evaluatable.

1522
01:03:15,336 --> 01:03:18,003
And it's also set up to do
your homework, okay,

1523
01:03:18,005 --> 01:03:19,738
which is to add those
variables,

1524
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:22,140
to be able to push operands
that are variables.

1525
01:03:22,142 --> 01:03:25,309
The other thing your homework
is gonna ask you to do is to

1526
01:03:25,311 --> 01:03:28,112
eval, to draw this, okay,

1527
01:03:28,114 --> 01:03:30,848
the contents of it in a human
readable form.

1528
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:33,850
Using infix notation like this
with parentheses when

1529
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:36,019
necessary, things like that
and

1530
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:37,820
that's gonna be a lot easier
here too.

1531
01:03:37,822 --> 01:03:39,055
Cuz you can recur,

1532
01:03:39,056 --> 01:03:40,289
use recursion, use recursion
to build this as well.

1533
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:43,725
Okay, so that's the main two
things of

1534
01:03:43,727 --> 01:03:44,693
your homework that's what they
are.

1535
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:48,496
All right, so let's see if we
broke anything here all right,

1536
01:03:48,498 --> 01:03:50,064
so we're gonna go up here and
run.

1537
01:03:52,168 --> 01:03:53,834
See if this all still works.

1538
01:03:53,836 --> 01:03:55,101
Our UI has not changed.

1539
01:03:55,103 --> 01:03:57,804
You notice I never even opened
the storyboard here.

1540
01:03:57,806 --> 01:03:59,005
Didn't even open the
storyboard.

1541
01:03:59,007 --> 01:04:01,607
Okay all these changes were
pushing things out of

1542
01:04:01,609 --> 01:04:03,175
the controller into the model.

1543
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:04,510
Okay?
The co,

1544
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:05,844
communication between the
controller and

1545
01:04:05,846 --> 01:04:08,012
the view has not changed here.

1546
01:04:08,014 --> 01:04:10,915
So hopefully this is gonna
work let's try 85, and

1547
01:04:10,917 --> 01:04:13,083
our number entering is still
working in

1548
01:04:13,085 --> 01:04:15,252
our controller that's good,
Enter.

1549
01:04:15,254 --> 01:04:17,921
Okay it still says 85 that's
good,

1550
01:04:17,923 --> 01:04:22,224
how about 41 plus seems to
actually be working.

1551
01:04:22,226 --> 01:04:23,325
Square root,

1552
01:04:23,327 --> 01:04:26,861
that's also working, nine
times, excellent.

1553
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,813
That's working.

1554
01:04:28,814 --> 01:04:30,764
Now what if we do something
that's not evaluatable?

1555
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:33,034
I'm going to press times a
whole bunch of times.

1556
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:33,901
Right?
Times, times.

1557
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:35,736
Oh, times no, zero.

1558
01:04:35,738 --> 01:04:37,404
See that's not really great
feedback.

1559
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:41,207
Okay?
But, it's not really zero but

1560
01:04:41,209 --> 01:04:43,642
it's, it's not good either.

1561
01:04:43,644 --> 01:04:46,912
So your homework is going to
be printing out what's on

1562
01:04:46,914 --> 01:04:48,747
the stack in a nice form so

1563
01:04:48,749 --> 01:04:50,548
you'll be able to see that you
have times, times,

1564
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:53,918
times, and it's gonna equal a
blank display.

1565
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,353
And that's gonna make sense
that it's blank.

1566
01:04:56,355 --> 01:04:57,020
'Kay?

1567
01:04:57,022 --> 01:04:59,422
All right.

1568
01:04:59,424 --> 01:05:01,724
Now, I wanna do one other
thing here, though, just so

1569
01:05:01,726 --> 01:05:03,659
you can really visualize
what's going on,

1570
01:05:03,661 --> 01:05:05,561
which is, I wanna print out,

1571
01:05:05,563 --> 01:05:08,630
when we evaluate, I wanna
print out this stack.

1572
01:05:08,632 --> 01:05:10,265
I wanna print out the thing
we're evaluating,

1573
01:05:10,267 --> 01:05:12,934
I wanna print out the result,
and I even wanna print out

1574
01:05:12,936 --> 01:05:14,702
the remainder here so we can
see what's going on.

1575
01:05:14,704 --> 01:05:17,471
So, I wanna say print ln.

1576
01:05:17,473 --> 01:05:21,841
And I'm gonna say I'm gonna
use my backslash thing here.

1577
01:05:21,843 --> 01:05:30,916
Op stack equals result with
how did I say this?

1578
01:05:30,918 --> 01:05:32,685
With [NOISE], oh, yeah.

1579
01:05:32,687 --> 01:05:36,688
With our remainder left over.

1580
01:05:37,857 --> 01:05:39,507
Okay.

1581
01:05:39,508 --> 01:05:41,158
So wouldn't it be cool if I
could just do this.

1582
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:44,361
Just say, okay, the op stack
evaluated equals this

1583
01:05:44,363 --> 01:05:47,064
result with the remainder left
over.

1584
01:05:47,066 --> 01:05:47,897
Okay?

1585
01:05:47,899 --> 01:05:48,765
Let's run that.

1586
01:05:48,766 --> 01:05:49,632
Do you think that's going to
work?

1587
01:05:51,302 --> 01:05:52,468
Maybe.
Let's see.

1588
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:54,336
[BLANK_AUDIO]

1589
01:05:54,338 --> 01:05:56,204
Okay.

1590
01:05:56,205 --> 01:05:58,071
So let's try putting eight on
the stack.

1591
01:05:59,709 --> 01:06:01,375
Okay?

1592
01:06:01,376 --> 01:06:03,042
Let's make so we can see this
over here, where is it,

1593
01:06:03,045 --> 01:06:06,213
it's this probably right
there, there it is.

1594
01:06:06,215 --> 01:06:08,114
We don't need that one okay,
so

1595
01:06:08,116 --> 01:06:11,117
here is our okay it's gonna be
that, it's this.

1596
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:16,288
Okay, so it said here hm, enum
value in, in an array, equals

1597
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:21,860
result of optional 8, that's
good, optional 8 is good.

1598
01:06:21,862 --> 01:06:23,161
With nothing left over.

1599
01:06:23,163 --> 01:06:24,962
Okay, that's good.

1600
01:06:24,964 --> 01:06:26,397
Let's go 6, Enter.

1601
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:30,734
Oh, now we have enum enum on
the stack equals optional 6,

1602
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:32,602
with enum left over.

1603
01:06:32,604 --> 01:06:33,936
Well that's not so good.

1604
01:06:33,938 --> 01:06:38,807
Times enum, enum, enum equals
it with, this is terrible.

1605
01:06:38,809 --> 01:06:40,342
This is, I can't understand
what the heck is

1606
01:06:40,344 --> 01:06:41,342
going on here.

1607
01:06:41,344 --> 01:06:42,943
Why is this happening?

1608
01:06:42,945 --> 01:06:47,014
Okay, when you put something
in parentheses like this,

1609
01:06:47,016 --> 01:06:49,315
it tries to convert it to a
string.

1610
01:06:49,317 --> 01:06:51,718
Okay, well the thing that's in
here is an array.

1611
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:54,520
Arrays know how to convert
themselves to strings.

1612
01:06:54,522 --> 01:06:57,623
What they do is, they put open
square bracket.

1613
01:06:57,625 --> 01:07:00,759
Then they ask every single
thing in the array,

1614
01:07:00,761 --> 01:07:04,462
convert yourself to a string
'kay, and it puts them here.

1615
01:07:04,464 --> 01:07:07,298
Well our op is converting
itself to this string.

1616
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:10,334
Enum value 'kay?

1617
01:07:10,336 --> 01:07:12,670
That's because the system
doesn't really know how to

1618
01:07:12,672 --> 01:07:14,171
convert it any other way so

1619
01:07:14,173 --> 01:07:15,872
it's just saying that's an
enum value.

1620
01:07:15,874 --> 01:07:18,241
It doesn't know how to convert
itself to a string.

1621
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:20,376
So, you see, see what's going
on here?

1622
01:07:20,378 --> 01:07:24,146
So, I'm going to show you how
to teach a type to

1623
01:07:24,148 --> 01:07:26,381
turn itself into a string.

1624
01:07:26,383 --> 01:07:28,716
Okay, cuz that's really
valuable for debugging and

1625
01:07:28,718 --> 01:07:30,651
also might be valuable for
your homework.

1626
01:07:33,756 --> 01:07:35,356
So, how we gonna do that?

1627
01:07:35,357 --> 01:07:36,957
All right, the way you do that
is,

1628
01:07:36,959 --> 01:07:42,595
you have to add a computed
property to your type.

1629
01:07:42,597 --> 01:07:44,730
And enums, just like structs
and

1630
01:07:44,732 --> 01:07:47,599
classes, can have properties,
okay?

1631
01:07:47,601 --> 01:07:50,435
Only computer properties in
enums, structs and

1632
01:07:50,437 --> 01:07:53,104
classes can have properties
that are values.

1633
01:07:53,106 --> 01:07:56,240
Like these, like this over
here, all right.

1634
01:07:56,242 --> 01:07:57,408
But they can only be computed.

1635
01:07:57,410 --> 01:08:00,344
You remember a computer
property looks like this, var.

1636
01:08:00,346 --> 01:08:01,929
The name of it.

1637
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:03,513
It has to be called
description because

1638
01:08:03,515 --> 01:08:05,081
it's gonna be a string
description of it.

1639
01:08:05,083 --> 01:08:07,517
The type has to be string.

1640
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:09,418
It's a string description of
it.

1641
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:12,588
And then of course you want
your get here.

1642
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:18,360
And, whoops, your get and your
set set.

1643
01:08:18,362 --> 01:08:21,896
But it has to not only be a
computer property.

1644
01:08:21,898 --> 01:08:24,165
This description thing to make
this work.

1645
01:08:24,167 --> 01:08:26,900
It wants to be a read only
one.

1646
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:28,068
So we're not going to put the
set,

1647
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:29,769
so there will be no set, just
a get.

1648
01:08:30,805 --> 01:08:36,108
So this get just has to return
this op as a string, so

1649
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:38,176
I say someone turned it into a
string.

1650
01:08:38,178 --> 01:08:40,045
Well how would we turn our op
into a string.

1651
01:08:40,047 --> 01:08:44,749
Well for the operations we're
just gonna return the symbol.

1652
01:08:44,751 --> 01:08:47,484
Okay if this is a plus
operation turning into

1653
01:08:47,486 --> 01:08:49,052
string is I'm just gonna
return a plus,

1654
01:08:49,054 --> 01:08:53,389
cuz that pretty well describes
a plus operation, a plus.

1655
01:08:53,391 --> 01:08:55,224
For the operand,

1656
01:08:55,225 --> 01:08:57,058
I'm gonna have to turn this
double into a string.

1657
01:08:57,061 --> 01:08:58,627
And return that.

1658
01:08:58,629 --> 01:08:59,528
Okay so how am I gonna do
that?

1659
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:03,131
I'm gonna do that using
switch,

1660
01:09:03,133 --> 01:09:05,867
I need to switch on myself.

1661
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:09,837
Okay cuz I'm gonna do this
switch so that I can get these

1662
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:12,939
same things out here, and you
do the same thing I did here,

1663
01:09:12,941 --> 01:09:14,307
see how I did this switch.

1664
01:09:14,309 --> 01:09:16,309
So I could get these
associated values out.

1665
01:09:16,311 --> 01:09:18,177
I'm gonna do the same thing
here.

1666
01:09:18,179 --> 01:09:20,512
So how do I switch on my self?

1667
01:09:20,514 --> 01:09:23,415
I say switch self.

1668
01:09:23,417 --> 01:09:24,716
'Kay?

1669
01:09:24,718 --> 01:09:28,019
And then I just have to say
the case for operand.

1670
01:09:28,021 --> 01:09:29,987
And I'll let that be the
operand.

1671
01:09:29,989 --> 01:09:33,657
And I have to do the case for
unary operation.

1672
01:09:33,659 --> 01:09:34,624
Now when I do the case for

1673
01:09:34,626 --> 01:09:37,493
unary operation, I want the
symbol.

1674
01:09:37,495 --> 01:09:40,529
But I don't care about the
function.

1675
01:09:40,531 --> 01:09:42,831
Cuz I'm not actually gonna
compute anything.

1676
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:45,500
I'm just going to return the
symbol.

1677
01:09:45,502 --> 01:09:47,469
And then for binary options
same,

1678
01:09:47,471 --> 01:09:51,972
same thing I want the symbol
but I don't want this.

1679
01:09:51,974 --> 01:09:53,307
So that's the, the don't care.

1680
01:09:53,309 --> 01:09:55,609
And what am I gonna do in each
of these cases?

1681
01:09:55,611 --> 01:10:01,080
Well in the operands case I'm
gonna return a string that

1682
01:10:01,082 --> 01:10:02,848
is that operand.

1683
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:06,251
Oops, don't like the way it
puts that extra thing

1684
01:10:06,253 --> 01:10:06,985
on there.

1685
01:10:06,987 --> 01:10:08,286
Okay.

1686
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:09,586
And then in the unary
operation case I'm

1687
01:10:09,589 --> 01:10:11,522
just gonna return the symbol.

1688
01:10:11,524 --> 01:10:13,390
And in the binary operation
case I'm also just

1689
01:10:13,392 --> 01:10:14,224
gonna return the symbol.

1690
01:10:14,226 --> 01:10:19,329
And we have, oops, don't want
the parentheses there.

1691
01:10:19,331 --> 01:10:22,965
Kay and we've covered every
case of this switch.

1692
01:10:22,967 --> 01:10:25,735
So not only does it know that
this switch is covered but

1693
01:10:25,737 --> 01:10:28,604
it knows that we for sure have
returned something out of

1694
01:10:28,606 --> 01:10:31,506
here, because we only have one
expression here which is

1695
01:10:31,508 --> 01:10:34,909
this Swift and switch and we
know that covers every case.

1696
01:10:34,911 --> 01:10:36,377
So there goes so we have this
nice description.

1697
01:10:36,379 --> 01:10:40,814
Now this is not quite enough
'kay?

1698
01:10:40,816 --> 01:10:42,916
You have to implement this
property,

1699
01:10:42,918 --> 01:10:44,784
this computer property
read-only.

1700
01:10:44,786 --> 01:10:46,652
But if you do one other thing,

1701
01:10:46,654 --> 01:10:50,456
which is up here, you have to
put, colon printable.

1702
01:10:51,859 --> 01:10:56,961
Now, I told you enums and
structs have no inheritance.

1703
01:10:56,963 --> 01:10:58,696
So you're like what, wait a
second, there.

1704
01:10:58,698 --> 01:11:01,098
You're telling me op inherits
from printable?

1705
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:04,234
And the answer is no, does not
inherit, okay, it's an enum.

1706
01:11:04,236 --> 01:11:07,070
Enums don't have any
inheritance, only classes do.

1707
01:11:07,072 --> 01:11:10,540
What this colon printable
means is, and

1708
01:11:10,542 --> 01:11:12,842
this can be true for classes
or structs or whatever.

1709
01:11:12,844 --> 01:11:14,643
You can put after the colon
here.

1710
01:11:15,713 --> 01:11:17,979
This is called a protocol.

1711
01:11:17,981 --> 01:11:21,215
And all this means is you're
telling Swift that this

1712
01:11:21,217 --> 01:11:24,852
enum implements whatever is in
this protocol.

1713
01:11:24,854 --> 01:11:28,389
And this protocol happens to
just be one computer

1714
01:11:28,391 --> 01:11:30,590
property called Description
that returns the string.

1715
01:11:31,826 --> 01:11:33,326
Okay?

1716
01:11:33,327 --> 01:11:34,827
Now we're going to talk about
protocols in depth.

1717
01:11:34,829 --> 01:11:37,062
Because protocols are very
important for

1718
01:11:37,064 --> 01:11:40,065
explaining how things work
'kay?

1719
01:11:40,067 --> 01:11:43,501
But we're not gonna cover it
today, though.

1720
01:11:43,503 --> 01:11:46,204
Okay, so if you do those two
things, put description in

1721
01:11:46,206 --> 01:11:52,209
printable, now when we run,
you'll see, I'll go 5 enter.

1722
01:11:52,211 --> 01:11:54,511
Six, and you see it's put a
five in there.

1723
01:11:54,513 --> 01:11:55,512
There's a 6.

1724
01:11:55,514 --> 01:11:57,447
Times, it's even putting the
times.

1725
01:11:57,449 --> 01:11:59,915
If I hit times again, now I
get nil and

1726
01:11:59,917 --> 01:12:03,652
i tshows me the whole thing is
leftover, okay.

1727
01:12:03,654 --> 01:12:06,454
Let's go another thing here,

1728
01:12:06,456 --> 01:12:10,358
what if I go 6 Enter 5 Enter 4
Enter.

1729
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,661
Now if I do times it says
times of 4 and

1730
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:18,098
5 is 20 with the 6 left over,
exactly right.

1731
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:22,368
Kay now notice I had to rerun
there to do that,

1732
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:24,303
you're gonna have a clear
button right,

1733
01:12:24,305 --> 01:12:25,571
that you do in assignment one,
you're gonna have to

1734
01:12:25,573 --> 01:12:27,239
make that work in assignment
two as well.

1735
01:12:28,308 --> 01:12:31,309
Okay the last thing really out
of time but I'm gonna show you

1736
01:12:31,311 --> 01:12:34,311
the last thing really quickly
that I was gonna do is use

1737
01:12:34,313 --> 01:12:38,182
this description to fix this
problem I said right here.

1738
01:12:38,184 --> 01:12:41,385
Which is what if I had a
function called learn

1739
01:12:41,387 --> 01:12:45,388
op 'kay and it took an op as
an argument here.

1740
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:53,029
And it just said known ops ops
description equals that op.

1741
01:12:53,031 --> 01:12:59,368
You see, now these could all
just be learn op this.

1742
01:13:00,404 --> 01:13:03,438
Okay which is a lot nicer, I
only have to type this thing

1743
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,306
once, and I just use the
description here.

1744
01:13:05,308 --> 01:13:08,875
The other thing about this,
notice where this function is.

1745
01:13:08,877 --> 01:13:10,143
Inside the init.

1746
01:13:11,246 --> 01:13:12,545
Okay you are allowed to

1747
01:13:12,547 --> 01:13:14,513
put functions inside other
functions.

1748
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:17,549
If this is only called inside
here, you can put it in here.

1749
01:13:17,551 --> 01:13:20,518
If if I put it outside in fact
I'd have a little a problem,

1750
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,387
because it would have to be
private.

1751
01:13:22,389 --> 01:13:26,390
Because it uses op, and that's
what this error right here is.

1752
01:13:26,392 --> 01:13:29,460
All right I'd have say private
func, but I don't want to do

1753
01:13:29,462 --> 01:13:32,462
private func, instead I'm just
gonna put this right down

1754
01:13:32,464 --> 01:13:35,131
here, okay and obviously I
would do that one last.

1755
01:13:35,133 --> 01:13:37,333
Okay that's it, hope you
learned a lot and

1756
01:13:37,335 --> 01:13:40,236
stuff elsewhere for that and I
will see you on Wednesday,

1757
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:42,037
I'm here if you have
questions.
