179
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,026
And so, we're going to have some coding here,
所以，我们准备在这里添加一些代码

00:08:34,977 --> 00:08:39,846
Now one thing that we can do inside this model.
现在在这个 model中有一件事我们可以做

189
00:08:41,282 --> 00:08:43,115
I put the curly braces here and
我在这里添加一个大括号然后

190
00:08:43,117 --> 00:08:44,750
you might say why did I put that there?
你可能会问我为什么我把它放在这里？

191
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:48,353
That is because I want to use the property observer for
那是因为我想要对我的 model使用属性观察器

192
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:52,790
my model to, essentially, validate my model.
实质上，验证我的 model

193
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:55,359
So you can use property observers to do evaluation,
所以你可以使用属性观察期去进行评估

194
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:57,527
really, of any property that you want.
任何你想查看的属性

195
00:08:57,529 --> 00:08:59,829
So my happiness can only be 0 to a 100.
所以我的 happiness 只能在 0 到 100内

196
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,865
If someone passes me happiness minus 1 or
如果一个人传给我的 happiness 负1或者

197
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:07,236
5,000 I need to kind of keep it in range to 0 to 100.
5000 我需要将它保持在 0到100的范围内

198
00:09:07,238 --> 00:09:09,871
So I'm just going to say, in my setter here,
所以，我只是想说，在我的 setter中

199
00:09:09,873 --> 00:09:11,606
my property observer here,
我的属性观察期中

200
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:18,279
I'm going to say min max of my happiness to 0 or 100,
我想说在我的 happiness中最小和最大的值是 0和100

201
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:21,048
so I'm just keeping it between zero and a hundred, right?
因此我将把它保持在0到100之间, 对么?

202
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,649
So no matter what someone passes me -1 or 5000,
无论输入了-1还是5000.

203
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:24,718
my happiness won't ever be outside of that.
我的"开心指数" 永远不会超出范围.

204
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,986
Again, this is kind of a trivial example.
再说一遍, 这是一个很简易的例子.

205
00:09:26,988 --> 00:09:28,854
You might have a much powerful model that
你可以有个更强大的Model.

206
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:31,457
needs much more powerful validation than this,
需要比这更严谨的评估.

207
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:34,526
but you can see this as a place to put it.
但是你能把它(这个Model)看做一个可行的方案.

208
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:36,461
Another thing you might want to have here is if someone
你可能想做的另一件事情是

209
00:09:36,463 --> 00:09:39,630
updates your model, you might want to update your UI.
如果有人改变了你的Model, 你可能想要更新你的UI.

210
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:42,333
Okay, so I'm going to have update UI,
好的, 因此我将升级UI.

211
00:09:42,335 --> 00:09:45,135
and I'm just going to have a function down here, update UI,
我将在下面这里加一个函数(Function), 叫updateUI.

212
00:09:45,137 --> 00:09:49,205
and it's going to do something to update the user interface,
它将会负责更新用户界面.

213
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:50,073
and that's a common thing.
更新UI是一件很寻常的事情.

214
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:51,440
When your model changes,
当你的Model改变时,

215
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:55,177
you want your controller to cause the UI to be updated.
你想让你的Controller将UI更新.

216
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:59,381
I think I'm going to put in here also is a little println
我还会在这里加个println() 命令,

217
00:09:59,383 --> 00:10:07,855
happiness equals back slash happiness.
Happiness =\  happiness.

218
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:12,125
Just so we can see our happiness changing in our
这样我们总是能在接下来的演示中,

219
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:15,962
console all the time as we work the rest of the demos.
在console(控制台)中看到happiness的变化.

220
00:10:15,964 --> 00:10:18,297
So we'll work on this update UI piece when we
好的,在我们回到demo之前,

221
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:20,299
get back to the demos.
解决更新UI这部分.

222
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,300
I just wanted to show you the model of happiness.
我就是想向你们展示Happiness的Model.

223
00:10:22,303 --> 00:10:24,503
Right now it's not hooked up to a it's UI.
现在, Model 并没有和UI关联.

224
00:10:24,505 --> 00:10:26,138
So if I run my application,
因此, 如果我现在运行应用

225
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:31,109
you'll see that this is not happiness of 50.
你们将会看到(结果)并不是50.

226
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:34,979
This is not even looking at the happiness.
甚至看上去不像是笑脸.

227
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:37,815
I could change this to anything that I want and
我可以把这个变成任何我想要的值

228
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:40,350
it's not going to change this.
但是这并不会改变运行结果.

229
00:10:40,352 --> 00:10:43,353
And so later we'll show you how we hook up our UI
所以, 稍后我会向你们展示如何通过Controller连接UI.

230
00:10:43,355 --> 00:10:44,687
to our model through our controller,
与Model关联.

231
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:46,555
that's one of the main things a controller does.
这个是Controller的主要功能之一.

232
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:51,026
Okay, so let's go back to our slides though.
好的, 现在我们回到幻灯片.

233
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:55,430
All right here, I'm going to start with this miscellaneous
好的, 我将以这个混杂的

234
00:10:55,432 --> 00:10:59,633
topic here, kind of a bonus topic, which is extensions.
主题开始, 类似于额外的主题, 它就是extensions(扩展).

235
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:01,835
You read about in your reading assignments, so
你已经在阅读作业里读到过了.

236
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:03,770
you know what this is,
你知道它是什么.

237
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:05,704
hopefully you've been reading those reading assignments.
希望你们一直以来都完成了阅读作业.

238
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,373
But I'm discovering here in class,
 但是我在课中发现,

239
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,975
not as much because it's an important feature per se but
并不与它本身本身的重要性相称

240
00:11:09,977 --> 00:11:12,011
it can be a little bit of a dangerous feature so
它(extensions)有时会变得有点危险,

241
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:14,212
I wanted to cover it a little bit.
因此我想讲一点这个.

242
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:16,481
So an extension is really simple.
extensions 真得很简单.

243
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:20,685
It's just a little syntax, to add methods and properties to
它就是一个给一个现存类(class), 结构(structure)

244
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:23,620
existing classes, structures, and enums.
和枚举(enums) 添加新方法或属性的小语法.

245
00:11:23,622 --> 00:11:25,355
Okay? You do not have to
好么? 你不是必须要

246
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:27,089
have the source code to those things you're adding it to.
有目标的源代码.

247
00:11:27,092 --> 00:11:29,893
You could just add these methods and
你可以就把这些方法和属性

248
00:11:29,895 --> 00:11:32,428
properties pretty much at will.
凭想法加入.

249
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:37,032
There are some restrictions, one is that you can't add via
这里有些限制, 其中之一是

250
00:11:37,034 --> 00:11:41,136
an extension a method or property that already exists.
你不能通过一个已存在的方法或特性添加extensions.

251
00:11:42,105 --> 00:11:45,306
So it's not a way to replace it, this is not sub classing,
因此这不是一个替换的手段, 这也不是创建子类,

252
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:47,941
you're not replacing or overwriting methods, so
你不能替换或者覆盖一个方法, 因此

253
00:11:47,943 --> 00:11:49,810
this has to be something where the property or
这些你想添加进类的的

254
00:11:49,812 --> 00:11:51,544
method you wanna add to a class.
属性或方法

255
00:11:52,514 --> 00:11:53,612
Does not exist.
必须是之前不存在的.

256
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:55,614
The second thing is that any
第二个是

257
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,615
properties you add cannot have any storage.
你添加的属性不能有存储.

258
00:11:57,618 --> 00:11:59,818
Okay so they can only be computed properties,
好么? 因此这些属性只能是运算属性.

259
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,252
right the get, set, kind.
set 和 get 方法这类的.

260
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,454
That's the only kind of property you can have.
那是你唯一能添加的一种属性.

261
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,924
Okay, but inside an extension otherwise it kind of
好的, 但是在一个extension中, 相反, 它

262
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,026
looks like you're in the definition of class.
看起来有点像你在定义类.

263
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,694
You can refer to self if you want and
你可以把它指向self,如果你想,

264
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,396
that will be the thing that you are extending.
这样它就是你扩展的对象.

265
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:15,698
It's a pretty powerful feature actually.
这实际上是一个很强大的特性.

266
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:21,169
This feature is easily abused however people putting all
但是这个特性容易被误用, 人们把

267
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:24,139
kinds of adding methods to classes making it so it's
一些方法加进类里把它变得

268
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:28,542
completely not understandable of what that does anymore.
完全不能理解它是做什么的.

269
00:12:28,544 --> 00:12:32,713
It's also whoever designed the class thinks a lot about it,it's
另外, 设计这个类的人考虑了很多关于

270
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:34,781
API and what should be in it and what shouldn't and
它的API 和它应包含的和不包含的内容

271
00:12:34,783 --> 00:12:36,382
now all of the sudden things are being added.
但是现在突然加了这么多东西.

272
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:37,216
That's kind of weird.
这有些奇怪.

273
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:40,686
This is really best used for beginners like you
它对你们这些初学Swift的人

274
00:12:40,688 --> 00:12:44,556
who are just starting with SWIFT to add little
最有用的地方是加入一些

275
00:12:44,558 --> 00:12:47,859
helper functions to enhance the readability of your code.
小的help function(帮助函数)以增强代码的可读性.

276
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:49,193
Okay, so if there's something that it would be
好的, 如果cgrect能做这件事

277
00:12:49,195 --> 00:12:53,563
really great if a cgrect could do this little thing, you
那么真的会很棒.

278
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,665
could add a little extension to a cgrect to do that.
你可以给cgrect加个extension来做到这点.

279
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:58,067
Or maybe a UI view controller just once.
或者给UI view controller 加一次.

280
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:01,137
This extra little property that it can calculate about itself.
这个额外的属性能计算它本身的.

281
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,307
That's the kind of thing that you could use it for.
这些是你能用extensions做到的事情.

282
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:09,010
Now extensions actually can be used by advanced Swift users
现在extensions实际上能被进阶Swift用户

283
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:13,047
to architects or, for architects, to really organize all your code.
用来整理或设计全部代码.

284
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:14,682
Because you can
因为你可以

285
00:13:14,683 --> 00:13:16,316
put almost everything into extensions, and
把几乎所有的东西放在extensions中

286
00:13:16,318 --> 00:13:19,552
use extensions as basically groupings of functionality.
并且把extensions基本等同于给功能分组来用.

287
00:13:19,554 --> 00:13:21,988
And so, it's really a powerful feature and
因此它真的是非常强大的特性.

288
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,657
I don't want to make it sound like it's only for
我不想让它听起来好像

289
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:28,060
little kinda dribes and drabs add tiny little helper things.
它只能零碎地加些帮助注释.

290
00:13:28,062 --> 00:13:30,862
It can actually be used as a core foundation of how you
它能被当做核心基础使用,

291
00:13:30,864 --> 00:13:32,664
architect.
来帮助你规划.

292
00:13:32,665 --> 00:13:34,465
But that does require some one to sit down and
但是完成它需要某人坐下来

293
00:13:34,468 --> 00:13:36,634
have an architectural plan to do that and
并且有一个设计计划.

294
00:13:36,636 --> 00:13:39,870
you obviously a little early in the game to be doing that.
现在你们这样做很显然有点早了.

295
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:42,206
So I would say, when in doubt, if you're not sure whether or
因此, 我会说, 如果你有点迷惘,

296
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,707
not you should make something an extension,
不知道这里是否要加extensions,

297
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:45,041
don't do it for now.
现在这个阶段就不用加了.

298
00:13:45,043 --> 00:13:46,743
And over time, you'll get more comfortable with it,
随着时间, 你会越来越适应是用它,

299
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:49,345
you'll understand what to do.
你会明白怎么做.

300
00:13:49,347 --> 00:13:51,246
And again, the syntax for
再说一遍, 它的语法

301
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,648
it is all explained in the documentation.
全部在文件里写得清清楚楚.

302
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:57,085
Maybe in the demo here, I'll try and throw one in, so
可能在今天的演示里, 我会加一个.

303
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,087
you can see what it looks like.
这样的话你们会明白它到是什么样的.

304
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,588
That was just an aside,
这些只是顺带提一提,

305
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,390
now let's get back to the main guts, okay?
现在我们回到真正的干货, 好么?

306
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:05,559
This very important feature called delegation,
有个非常重要的特性叫做委托(delegation)

307
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:07,427
I have to teach you about protocols first,
我先要教你们协议(protocols),

308
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,063
again you probably read about this in reading assignments,
你们应该已经在阅读作业里读到过这些了,

309
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:12,064
but I want to go over it anyway.
无论怎样我重头说一遍,

310
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:15,534
A protocol is basically a way to express your
一个协议基本上是

311
00:14:15,536 --> 00:14:18,503
API a little more minimally.
一种相对简便的表示API的方法.

312
00:14:18,505 --> 00:14:22,073
Not to drag in so much API by, for example,
不是通过添加比如

313
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:25,376
having an argument to a function be a class where now
传递一个代表类的参数给函数,

314
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:27,545
you're passing an entire class into that function,
你把整个类传递给了那个函数.

315
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:30,047
who knows what that function might do with that class.
谁知道那个函数会让那个类做什么.

316
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:34,017
It could access the entire non private API of that thing.
函数很能会访问类的所有的非私有API.

317
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,586
So really, the function just wants to use the one method of
所以, 说真的, 这个函数只是想用类中

318
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:37,520
a class.
的一个方法而已.

319
00:14:37,522 --> 00:14:39,689
Protocols are a way for
协议是函数的一种表达方式,

320
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,857
the function to express or really, I just want you to
或者, 我只是想让你给我

321
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:43,926
pass me something that can do this one function.
一些能让这个函数运作的东西.

322
00:14:43,928 --> 00:14:45,894
Because that's what I'm going to call in here.
因为我要再这里调用这些东西.

323
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:49,197
So, it's a way to kind of minimize your API.
所以, 这是一个简化API的方法.

324
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,432
A protocol is a type.
一个协议是一个数据类型.

325
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:54,535
Okay, it's just like a class, or an enum, or a struct.
就像一个class, 或者enums, 或者struct.

326
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:55,620
Okay. It's a type.
好么, 它是一个数据类型.

327
00:14:55,621 --> 00:14:56,704
It can be used everywhere a type is.
它可以被用在任何数据类型能用的地方.

328
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:58,372
A type of an argument to a function.
一个函数的参数,

329
00:14:58,374 --> 00:15:02,342
A var or a let can be a protocol.
一个变量或者一个let 也能是一个协议.

330
00:15:02,344 --> 00:15:04,844
Type. So it is absolutely a type.
类型, 因此它绝对是一个数据类型.

331
00:15:04,846 --> 00:15:07,112
The only thing that is interesting about it is it
唯一一个有趣的地方是,

332
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,380
has no implementation.
协议本身是没有实现的.

333
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:10,999
Okay?
好么?

334
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,650
In fact, it's kind of the definition of a protocol,
事实上, 这类似于协议的定义.

335
00:15:12,652 --> 00:15:15,052
it's a type with no implementation.
这是一个没有实现的数据类型.

336
00:15:15,054 --> 00:15:16,553
It only has declaration.
它只有声明

337
00:15:17,623 --> 00:15:20,623
Use a protocol to declare various properties and
用协议来声明很多变量

338
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,191
methods but it has no implementation.
和方法, 但是没有相应的实现.

339
00:15:22,193 --> 00:15:25,628
The implementation is provided by other objects that conform
"实现"是由其它遵从协议的对象

340
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,162
to the protocol.
提供的.

341
00:15:27,164 --> 00:15:29,214
Okay, and there might be
好的, 可能会有成百个

342
00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:31,265
hundreds of objects that will conform to a certain protocol.
遵从某同一个协议的对象,

343
00:15:31,268 --> 00:15:33,635
Okay?
好么?

344
00:15:33,636 --> 00:15:36,003
But the protocol when you use it looks just like a type,
但是, 协议在使用的时候看起来就是个数据类型.

345
00:15:36,006 --> 00:15:37,605
exactly like a type as you're gonna see here.
你们将会看到, 跟数据类型一模一样.

346
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:41,409
Now there's three aspects to a protocol, to using one.
这有三个使用协议的条件.

347
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:43,277
One is the declaration of the protocol.
一个是协议的声明.

348
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,112
This looks a lot like declaring your class or
这看起来很像声明你的class,

349
00:15:45,114 --> 00:15:46,346
an enum or struct.
或者enums或者struct.

350
00:15:46,348 --> 00:15:47,847
It's just that there is no implementations for
它仅仅是没有任何属性或方法

351
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,782
any of the properties or methods.
的实现.

352
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:52,484
Then there's the declaration part where a class or
接着, 声明的部分会出现,

353
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:56,455
a struct or an enum says, I will implement this protocol.如果一个class, struct 或者enum说我会实现这个协议.

354
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:59,724
So it declares that it will conform to, or implement,
因此它声明它会遵从或者实现

355
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:00,958
this protocol.
这个协议.

356
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,294
And then there's the part where that class, struct or
接着, 在class, struct 或者enum

357
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,095
enum actually implements the protocol.
会有负责实现协议的部分.

358
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,064
So, it implements that, all the properties and
所以, 它会实现, 所有在协议中需要的

359
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,833
methods in the protocol that's required, all of them.
属性和方法, 所有的.

360
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,351
Okay?
好么?

361
00:16:11,352 --> 00:16:12,868
So we'll see what that looks like in some code.
我们会在几行代码里看到(协议)到底是怎样.

362
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,871
So here's a declaration of a protocol itself, okay?
这里是协议自身的声明, 好么?

363
00:16:15,873 --> 00:16:19,107
The protocol's called some protocol, all right?
这个协议叫做"某个协议"(Some protocol), 好么?

364
00:16:20,877 --> 00:16:25,179
This protocol has really what some might call
这个协议有些叫做

365
00:16:25,181 --> 00:16:27,981
inherited protocols, or a protocol that inherits.
继承协议,或者, 一个协议它能够继承.

366
00:16:27,983 --> 00:16:31,218
Which are other protocols that if you want to implement some
如果你想要实现某些协议,

367
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,586
protocol you have to implement those too.
你必须也将这些继承协议实现.

368
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:35,188
Okay that's what this colon thing, so
这就是代码里冒号所代表的.

369
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,390
it kind of looks like this super class kind of thing but
这感觉上有点像父类,

370
00:16:37,392 --> 00:16:39,491
there can be multiple of them, but it's not really
但是能够有很多不同的继承协议.

371
00:16:39,493 --> 00:16:42,060
inherent in this, per se, like you think of in classes, it's
继承协议并不是跟你想象中的类那样

372
00:16:42,062 --> 00:16:44,429
more just saying if you want to implement some protocol you
我想说的是, 如果你想要实现协议,

373
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:46,497
also have to implement inherited protocol one and
你必须还要实现继承协议1

374
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:47,665
inherited protocol two.
以及继承协议2.

375
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:48,766
If you don't implement those then you
如果你没有实现这些, 也就是

376
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:51,268
haven't implemented all of some protocol.
没有实现所有的协议.

377
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:51,835
Okay?好么?

378
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:57,406
Now you have to specify, when you do a property,
现在你必须明确, 当你设计一个属性,

379
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:58,740
you don't put the implementation there but
你并不加入实现部分

380
00:16:58,742 --> 00:17:01,976
you have to classify whether this is a get only property or
但是你必须区分这是一个只有get的属性

381
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:04,012
it's a get and set, okay?
还是既有get也有set.

382
00:17:04,014 --> 00:17:05,279
The system needs to know whether it's
系统需要知道它是否是一个set方法

383
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:08,182
a set because structs and enums are value types and
因为structs和enums都是数据类型并且

384
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:09,950
it needs to know when it's being mutated so
它需要知道什么时候被改变

385
00:17:09,952 --> 00:17:12,852
it can copy them and etcetera, okay?这样的话它才能复制和其他之类的, 好么?

386
00:17:12,854 --> 00:17:17,223
Any functions that are expected to mutate also need
任何可能会被更改的函数还需要

387
00:17:17,225 --> 00:17:20,492
to be noted with this mutating keyword, okay?
用这个mutating关键字标注

388
00:17:20,494 --> 00:17:22,060
You probably read that in the description,
你可能在描述文件里读到了.

389
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:24,095
you know that structs and enums,
你知道structs和enums,

390
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:27,398
insert value types, the system needs to know when a function
插入值类型, 系统需要知道函数

391
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,869
is actually changing them, so they can copy it on demand.
具体什么时候会改变它们, 这样它们能根据需求复制.

392
00:17:33,272 --> 00:17:36,039
It is possible to limit your protocol to only work
限制你的协议只能和类一起

393
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,141
with classes.
工作是可行的

394
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:40,242
You put the word class right after that colon.
你把class这个词放在那个冒号后面,

395
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:42,878
So SomeProtocol colon class means this protocol can
这样"SomeProtocol: class" 意味着

396
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,279
only be implemented by a class.
它只能被类实现.

397
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:46,782
It cannot be implemented by a struct or an enum.
它不能被一个struct或者enum实现.

398
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:47,549
Okay? Then you wouldn't need
好么? 这样你不需要

399
00:17:47,551 --> 00:17:49,584
any mutatings because a class,
任何 mutatings，因为这是一个类

400
00:17:49,586 --> 00:17:52,620
since it's a reference passed by reference all the time,
这是个引用，并且一直以引用被传递

401
00:17:52,622 --> 00:17:56,190
you can obviously mutate with any method or property.
因此你可以通过任何方法或者属性进行 mutate

402
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:59,226
Okay, you can even specify that
你甚至可以设计

403
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:02,095
a protocol requires the class or
一个协议，要求类或

404
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:05,531
structure enum to implement a certain initializer.
结构枚举去实现特定的初始化函数

405
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:06,833
Okay, that way you
通过这种方式，你知道你可以创建

406
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:08,134
know that you can create one of these things.
这些东西中的一个

407
00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:11,136
All right. So, that's kinda cool too.
这非常酷

408
00:18:11,138 --> 00:18:15,106
All right, so that's how you declare a protocol.
这就是你要怎样声明一个协议

409
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:16,741
See? It's pretty straightforward.
看到了吗？非常直观

410
00:18:16,743 --> 00:18:18,242
No implementations in here, right?
这里没有 implementations

411
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:22,279
All right, so now let's talk about the part of it where it
现在我们来讲这部分

412
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:23,680
says I'm an implementor.
称作 implementor

413
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:24,881
I want to implement this protocol.
我想实现这个协议

414
00:18:24,883 --> 00:18:28,250
How do I tell the world I'm going to implement this?
我怎么告诉这个世界我要实现它？

415
00:18:28,252 --> 00:18:31,353
You do that by putting at
要实现它，你要将它放在

416
00:18:31,355 --> 00:18:34,389
the end of the declaration of the thing, so here's class,
声明的末尾。这是个类

417
00:18:34,391 --> 00:18:37,625
SomeClass then it inherits from SuperclassOfSomeClass.
SomeClass 继承自 SuperclassOfSomeClass

418
00:18:37,627 --> 00:18:40,361
You just put a comma and all the protocols that
你可以放个逗号，还有这个类将要实现的

419
00:18:40,363 --> 00:18:43,998
this class is claiming to implement, okay?
所有协议

420
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,800
Now, obviously if this was a struct or
显然，这是个结构或者枚举

421
00:18:46,802 --> 00:18:49,302
enum it wouldn't have that superclass name.
它没有父类

422
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:51,004
So it would just be colon and then the list of
因此，它就只有一个冒号

423
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,873
all the protocols that it is claiming to implement.
还有它将实现的所有协议

424
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,175
So this enum says it's going to implement some protocol,
这个枚举将实现一些协议

425
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,077
and it's also going to implement another protocol.
同时它也将实现另一些协议

426
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:00,012
And once it says that, it has to do it or
一旦它声明了，它就必须实现（协议）

427
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:03,148
the compiler will not allow you to compile, okay?
否则编译器不让你通过编译

428
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,583
Same thing with the struct, all right?
结构也是一样的

429
00:19:05,585 --> 00:19:09,486
So pretty straightforward syntax there.
这是非常直观的语法

430
00:19:09,488 --> 00:19:11,722
The number of protocols is unlimited,
协议的数量是无限的

431
00:19:11,724 --> 00:19:13,590
you can just keep putting more and
你可以保留你将实现的日益增多的

432
00:19:13,592 --> 00:19:16,359
more protocols that you say you'll implement.
协议

433
00:19:16,361 --> 00:19:19,428
In a class, if you implement an init in a class,
在一个类中，如果你实现了一个类的初始化函数

434
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,464
you have to say it's required.
你必须使用 required（关键字）

435
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:24,516
Okay?

436
00:19:24,517 --> 00:19:26,567
So that's because you wouldn't want a subclasser
这是因为你不想一个子类使用

437
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,170
using the rules of inheritance of initializers which we
初始化函数的继承规则，这个我们

438
00:19:29,172 --> 00:19:32,507
talked about in depth last lecture or the one before.
在上次课或上上次课有深入讲解过

439
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:35,176
It can get to a situation where that init is
这有可能导致这样一种情况：子类

440
00:19:35,178 --> 00:19:37,644
not even implemented, okay, in sub class.
没有实现初始化函数

441
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:39,546
And that would be no good because you're saying
这样不好，因为你遵循了

442
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:42,115
you conform to this protocol and then that init is part of
这个协议，那初始化函数就是协议的一部分

443
00:19:42,117 --> 00:19:44,117
this protocol so you have to make them required.
所以你必须将它们标为 required

444
00:19:45,086 --> 00:19:45,651
Okay?

445
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:51,055
You are allowed to add protocol compliance or
你可以使用 extension 来添加

446
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,324
conformance with an extension.
协议的一致性

447
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,643
And this is very common to do,
这很常用

448
00:19:56,644 --> 00:19:58,894
again, in a bigger architected system, is you will implement
在一个大一点的架构系统中，你在类或结构枚举上

449
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:02,432
the entire implementation of a protocol on some class or
实现整个协议的内容是

450
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:06,035
structure enum by implementing it as an extension.
通过 extension 来实现的

451
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:07,636
Now the only thing about that implementation is,
现在关于 implementation 的唯一事情是

452
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:09,338
of course, no stored properties in there.
当然，这里没有存储属性

453
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,238
Only computer properties.
只有计算性的属性

454
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,340
So you would have to be able to
所以你不需要任何存储就能够实现

455
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:14,441
implement that entire protocol without any storage.
整个协议

456
00:20:14,444 --> 00:20:16,978
But a lot of protocols can be implemented without storage.
但很多协议可以不需要任何存储就实现了

457
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,314
Cuz they're fairly simple protocols, okay.
它们是些相当简单的协议

458
00:20:22,451 --> 00:20:26,286
Here's what it looks like to use a protocol as a type.
这里，看起来像是将协议当作一个类型来用

459
00:20:26,288 --> 00:20:30,389
So I've created a protocol called Moveable.
我已创建了一个协议，叫做 Moveable

460
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:31,657
It has one function in it,
它有一个函数

461
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:35,994
move to, which presumably moves the thing.
moveTo，这个函数大概是移动这个东西的

462
00:20:35,996 --> 00:20:37,929
I've created two things,
我创建了两个东西

463
00:20:37,931 --> 00:20:40,664
a class called car which is a moveable.
一个叫做 car 的类，这是一个 Moveable

464
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:43,534
So the car can be moved, and a class called,
因此这个 car 可以被移动，还有一个类

465
00:20:43,536 --> 00:20:46,303
or struct rather called shape which can be moveable, so this
更确切的说是结构，叫做 shape，这个可以被移动

466
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:48,571
might be a graphical shape that can be moved on screen.
这可能是一个可以在屏幕上被移动的图形形状

467
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:49,872
Now you see that car and
现在你看到 car 和

468
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,608
shape are completely different kinds of things, but
shape 是两个完全不同的东西

469
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,711
they both could be moved, so they both could be movables.
但它们都能被移动，所以它们都是可以移动的

470
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:59,081
And you can see that they both properly implement the movable
你们看，它们都正确地实现了 movable 协议

471
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,150
protocol and they both claimed implement movable.
它们都声明实现了 movable

472
00:21:02,152 --> 00:21:06,287
Then I've created a couple of little variables here prius
然后我创建了几个变量，prius 和

473
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:10,090
and square which are just instances of car and shape.
square，是 car 和 shape 的实例

474
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,094
Okay, so now let's look at some code.
现在我们看一些代码

475
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:17,563
I can create a variable called thing to move.
我可以创建一个变量，叫做 thingToMove

476
00:21:17,565 --> 00:21:19,899
It is of type moveable.
这是 moveable 类型

477
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:22,001
That's protocol, but protocols are types.
那是协议，但协议都是类型

478
00:21:22,003 --> 00:21:23,301
And I can set it equal to prius.
我可以让它等于 prius

479
00:21:23,303 --> 00:21:26,504
This is completely legal because a prius
这是完全合法的，因为一个 prius

480
00:21:26,506 --> 00:21:28,172
is a moveable, right?
就是一个 moveable

481
00:21:28,174 --> 00:21:29,507
It implements the moveable protocol.
它实现了 moveable 协议

482
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:32,409
So I can set a variable that is moveable to a prius,
因此我可以讲一个 moveable 的变量赋值 prius

483
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:32,976
works great.
非常棒

484
00:21:33,912 --> 00:21:36,713
I can then say thing to move, move to.
然后我可以使用 thingToMove.moveTo()

485
00:21:36,715 --> 00:21:40,216
Because thing to move is anything that implements
因为 thingToMove 是一个实现了 moveable

486
00:21:40,218 --> 00:21:41,250
the moveable protocol.
协议的任何东西

487
00:21:41,252 --> 00:21:46,955
However, I cannot say thing to move dot change oil, okay?
然而，我不能使用 thingMoveTo.changeOil()

488
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:49,190
Change oil is a car thing,
changOil 是 car 的方法

489
00:21:49,192 --> 00:21:51,359
it's not a moveable thing, okay?
不是 moveable 的方法

490
00:21:51,361 --> 00:21:52,893
So I can't send it to a moveable.
所以我不能在 moveable 中调用它

491
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:56,396
Even though, yes,
尽管如此

492
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:58,330
that thing to move happens to currently contain a car
这个 thingToMove 恰好包含了一个 car

493
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:01,034
it's still a compiler won't even let you put this in.
编译器不会让你这样使用

494
00:22:01,036 --> 00:22:02,001
It'll complain.
它会报错

495
00:22:02,003 --> 00:22:04,436
It'll say, thing to move is a moveable.
它会说，thingToMove 是一个 moveable

496
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:05,904
Moveables don't understand change oil.
Moveable 不懂 changeOil

497
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:07,639
You understand?
明白了吗？

498
00:22:08,842 --> 00:22:12,176
I could then say thingToMove equal square.
我可以让 thingToMove ＝ square

499
00:22:12,178 --> 00:22:15,279
That's perfectly legal as well cuz a square is a Moveable.
这是相当合法的，因为 square 是一个 Moveable

500
00:22:15,281 --> 00:22:17,147
It implements that protocol so it can do it as well.
它实现了这个协议，所以这也是可以的

501
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:23,619
More interestingly I could let thingsToMove be an array of
更有趣的是，我可以让 thingsToMove 为 [Moveable]

502
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:26,855
Moveable, and I could set it equal to an array that
让它等于包含 prius 和 square 的

503
00:22:26,857 --> 00:22:28,690
has a prius anda square in it.
一个数组

504
00:22:28,692 --> 00:22:34,862
So it's got a car and a shape, a class and a struct,
所以它有一个 car 和 shape，一个类和一个结构

505
00:22:34,864 --> 00:22:37,031
all in this array and it's perfectly legal because
都在这个数组中，这是合法的

506
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:39,566
they're both moveable so I can create an array of them
因为它们都是 moveable，因此我可以创建关于它们的数组

507
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:42,035
because moveable is a protocol It's just like a type.
moveable是一个协议，如同一种类型

508
00:22:42,037 --> 00:22:42,602
It is a type.
它就是一种类型

509
00:22:44,472 --> 00:22:45,771
Okay, make sense?
有道理吧？

510
00:22:45,773 --> 00:22:47,973
Why I can do that?
为什么我能这样做？

511
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:50,742
All right I can also have a function like slide,
我也可以有一个函数 slide

512
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,712
let's say that slide something along the ground or
就是在地上或其他地方滑动某物

513
00:22:53,714 --> 00:22:57,315
something, and you can take an argument which is unmovable.
你可以使用不是 moveable 的参数

514
00:22:57,317 --> 00:22:59,483
And then inside of it I can say move to and
然后在函数里面，我可以使用 moveTo

515
00:22:59,485 --> 00:23:01,719
that works fine, and I say slide prius,
这能正常工作，我可以使用 slide(prius)

516
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:04,254
slide square, all works fine because.
slide(square)，都能正常工作

517
00:23:04,256 --> 00:23:04,921
They're all moveable.
它们都是 moveable

518
00:23:04,923 --> 00:23:08,458
It's actually possible to declare an argument like slip
世界上，声明一个 slipAndSlide 是可以的

519
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,294
and slide, that implements two, that takes an argument
这个实现了两个，带一个参数，这个参数

520
00:23:12,296 --> 00:23:14,730
that has to implement two separate protocols.
必须实现两个不同的协议

521
00:23:14,732 --> 00:23:17,265
Moveable, but also something called slippery, let's say,
Moveable，还有 Slippery，Slippery这个

522
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:18,566
which I haven't defined.
我还没定义

523
00:23:18,568 --> 00:23:20,051
Okay, so

524
00:23:20,052 --> 00:23:21,535
this little thing where you say protocol angle bracket and
这个东西，你使用 protocol <，然后很多你想

525
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:24,305
then as many protocols as you want closed angle bracket,
实现的协议，最后以 > 结束

526
00:23:24,307 --> 00:23:27,241
that says this argument to this function has to implement
这表明这个参数必须实现

527
00:23:27,243 --> 00:23:29,076
both of those protocols.
这些协议中的两个

528
00:23:29,078 --> 00:23:31,211
Or all of those protocols.
或者所有这些协议

529
00:23:31,213 --> 00:23:32,445
And then if I tried to say slip and
如果我试图使用 slipAndSlide(prius)

530
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:35,014
slide Prius, not even compile.
是不能通过编译的

531
00:23:35,016 --> 00:23:36,749
Because while Prius is a moveable,
因为 prius 是一个 moveable

532
00:23:36,751 --> 00:23:38,216
it's not as slippery.
不是 slippery

533
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:39,918
And so it can't do that.
所以不能这么做

534
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,821
Can't be passed through that argument, okay?
不能传递这个参数

535
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:44,888
Everyone cool with protocols?
每个人都理解协议了吗？

536
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,590
Any question about that before I
在我开始讲解使用协议的代理（delegation）前，还有人

537
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,291
start talking about delegation which uses protocols?
有问题吗？

538
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:51,744
Okay. So

539
00:23:51,745 --> 00:23:53,595
delegation is a very important use of protocols.
代理是协议的一个非常重要用途

540
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,832
Delegation, if you remember back to our MVC talk right at
代理，如果你记得我们这节课刚开始讲的 MVC

541
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:59,901
the beginning of the quarter, we had this big graph.
我们有这个大图表

542
00:23:59,903 --> 00:24:02,704
And one of the things we showed was how views need to
我们讲的其中一点是，views 如何和它们的

543
00:24:02,706 --> 00:24:05,306
be able to talk back to their controller, okay?
controller 通讯

544
00:24:05,308 --> 00:24:07,174
But views are generic.
但 views 是普通的

545
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:09,276
So, they can't know anything about the class or
它们不知道使用它们的

546
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:10,744
the controller that's using them.
类或者 controller

547
00:24:10,746 --> 00:24:12,579
They're generic building blocks.
它们是普通的积木

548
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:14,180
Okay? So how do they talk back?
它们是怎么通讯的？

549
00:24:14,182 --> 00:24:16,649
Well, it turns out they talk back using protocols, okay,
实际上它们使用协议进行通信

550
00:24:16,651 --> 00:24:18,817
and this is called delegation.
这个叫做代理

551
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:19,384
Okay?

552
00:24:20,554 --> 00:24:22,887
So, let's talk a little bit about how that works,
让我们讲讲这是如何工作的

553
00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:24,989
how it plays out to do delegation.
代理是怎么玩的

554
00:24:24,991 --> 00:24:27,291
First, you're gonna create the delegate protocol.
首先，你要创建一个代理协议

555
00:24:27,293 --> 00:24:29,626
So, the delegate protocol is just gonna be protocol,
这个代理协议是一个协议

556
00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:31,661
something with a bunch of methods and
包含了许多方法，也

557
00:24:31,663 --> 00:24:33,529
perhaps even properties.
可能包含属性。

558
00:24:33,531 --> 00:24:37,800
And it's going to describe what the view is looking for
它描述了这个 view 要别人帮

559
00:24:37,802 --> 00:24:39,768
someone else to do for it.
它做的事情

560
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,136
Okay?

561
00:24:41,137 --> 00:24:42,503
It's gonna describe the responsibilities the view is
它描述了 view 要代理给其他人的

562
00:24:42,506 --> 00:24:44,038
going to delegate to someone else.
职责

563
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:46,807
Okay? So if this is a scroll view,
这是一个 scroll view

564
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:50,644
something the protocol might be, should scroll to point.
这个协议可能是，应该滚动到一个点

565
00:24:50,646 --> 00:24:52,946
The view wants to know should I scroll to this point?
这个 view 想知道我是否要滚动到这个点？

566
00:24:52,948 --> 00:24:54,147
The user's trying to scroll to this point.
用户试图滚动到这个点

567
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:55,147
Should I do it?
我应该处理这个吗？

568
00:24:55,149 --> 00:24:57,049
And the view doesn't know because it
view 并不知道，因为它不拥护

569
00:24:57,051 --> 00:24:58,634
doesn't own its own data.
自己的数据

570
00:24:58,635 --> 00:25:00,218
It doesn't really even know what it's scrolling on.
它甚至不知道它在什么东西上滚动

571
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,386
It needs to ask someone else.
它需要询问别人

572
00:25:01,388 --> 00:25:02,787
So it's going to create this protocol.
所以它要创建这个协议

573
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:05,389
Any time it either needs to notify someone else to
任何时候，它需要告知别人正在发生的有趣的

574
00:25:05,391 --> 00:25:06,724
something interesting that is happening or
事情，或者它

575
00:25:06,726 --> 00:25:09,226
ask someone else for permission to do something or
向他人请求权限去做一些事情或

576
00:25:09,228 --> 00:25:12,095
to try to get its data, which is a common thing.
获取自己的数据，这是非常常见的

577
00:25:12,097 --> 00:25:13,863
It wants its data that it's trying to draw but
它需要它尝试绘图的数据，但

578
00:25:13,865 --> 00:25:14,930
it can't own its own data.
它没有自己的数据

579
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:16,598
Remember views can't own their data,
记住 views 不能有自己的数据

580
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,567
the data is owned by the controller.
数据是被 controller 拥有的

581
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:19,868
Really, it's probably in the model, but
实际上，数据可能在 model 中

582
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:23,004
the controller is responsible for dishing the data out.
但 controller 负责取出数据

583
00:25:23,006 --> 00:25:25,306
So at first you're gonna create that protocol.
因此首先你要创建协议

584
00:25:25,308 --> 00:25:28,242
Then you're gonna create a property in your view,
然后你要在 view 中创建一个属性

585
00:25:28,244 --> 00:25:31,244
okay, called delegate or sometimes it's called data
称作代理或者有时叫做数据源

586
00:25:31,246 --> 00:25:34,047
source if it's delegating the data.
如果它代理数据的话

587
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:37,417
And the type of that property is
然后这个属性的类型是这个

588
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:39,318
this delegation protocol that you're gonna create.
你将创建的代理协议

589
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:41,687
Protocols are just types so
协议就是类型，就是属性将被

590
00:25:41,689 --> 00:25:44,122
that's what the property type is gonna be.
声明的类型

591
00:25:44,124 --> 00:25:47,525
Okay, then it's gonna use that property to go do all
然后它将使用这个属性去处理

592
00:25:47,527 --> 00:25:48,526
the delegation.
所有的代理

593
00:25:48,528 --> 00:25:50,327
It's going to send a message to
它将发送一个消息给代理属性

594
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:53,764
the delegate property saying, should I scroll to this point,
我是否要滚动到这个点

595
00:25:53,766 --> 00:25:55,832
it's going to send a message to this delegate property.
它将发送一条消息给代理属性

596
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:58,034
Maybe it will be called data source in this case, but
这个例子中它大概叫做 dataSource，但

597
00:25:58,036 --> 00:25:59,735
it's saying hey, where's my data?
它询问，我的数据在哪里？

598
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:01,503
Give me more of my data.
给我更多我的数据

599
00:26:01,505 --> 00:26:02,838
Okay? That's what it's going to
明白了吗？这就是它将要

600
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,806
send and it's going to send it to this object right here,
发送的消息，而且，它将会把这个消息发送给这里的对象

601
00:26:04,808 --> 00:26:06,858
this delegate property.
也就是这个 delegate 属性

602
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:08,909
And this delegate property, all it is is a protocol.
然后，这个 delegate 属性，完全就是一种协议

603
00:26:08,912 --> 00:26:12,013
So all that, anybody who implements that
所以，只要是任何遵循这个协议的对象

604
00:26:12,015 --> 00:26:14,548
protocol can be set as the value for that.
都可以对这个属性设值

605
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,115
Delegate.

606
00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:18,084
All right then the controller is going to come along and
好的，接下来的是控制器

607
00:26:18,086 --> 00:26:21,354
it's going to first say that it implements that protocol.
控制器首先会说，它自身实现了这个协议

608
00:26:21,356 --> 00:26:25,624
Okay, so it's a class thing, it's going to say, yeah,
由于它是一个类，那么它会说

609
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:28,226
I implement this view this delegate protocol.
我实现了这个视图的代理协议的方法

610
00:26:28,228 --> 00:26:29,260
Then the controller is going to
接着，控制器将

611
00:26:29,262 --> 00:26:32,163
set it's self as the delegate.
会将它自身作为代理对象

612
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:35,766
So it's going to set that delegate property inside
它会设置这个视图的代理属性为其自身

613
00:26:35,768 --> 00:26:39,703
the view to itself, which is fine because it just said it
这里没有任何问题，因为刚刚说了，它

614
00:26:39,705 --> 00:26:43,006
implements that protocol, so that's good.
声明自己已经实现了这个协议所需的方法

615
00:26:43,008 --> 00:26:45,042
Then, of course,
接下来，当然

616
00:26:45,043 --> 00:26:47,077
the controllers going to have to implement the protocol, and
这个控制器将填充这些方法，这些协议方法的具体实现细节

617
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,779
implement all the methods and properties required by
并不一定要实现协议规定的所有方法，但是

618
00:26:49,781 --> 00:26:52,381
the protocol so that it conforms to that protocol.
一定需要实现这个协议必需（required）的方法

619
00:26:52,383 --> 00:26:53,782
Otherwise compiler is going to complain.
否则编译器会报错

620
00:26:55,085 --> 00:26:56,217
And you're good to go.
这就可以了

621
00:26:56,219 --> 00:26:58,886
Now the view is hooked up to the controller, okay?
现在，这个视图已经和控制器建立关系了，明白了吗？

622
00:26:58,888 --> 00:27:00,688
But the view still knows nothing about the controller.
但是视图仍旧不知道控制器是什么东西

623
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,855
It doesn't know what class it is.
不知道控制器的类是什么

624
00:27:01,857 --> 00:27:03,423
It doesn't know what its purpose in life is.
不知道控制器的目的是什么

625
00:27:03,425 --> 00:27:05,142
It knows nothing.
什么都不知道

626
00:27:05,143 --> 00:27:06,860
All it knows is it implements the methods in its protocol,
唯一知道的是，这个控制器实现了视图中的协议必需的方法

627
00:27:06,862 --> 00:27:08,094
in the views protocol.

628
00:27:08,096 --> 00:27:09,662
That's all it knows and that's all it needs to know.
这就是所有它想知道的，和它应该知道的

629
00:27:10,598 --> 00:27:12,998
Okay? So that keeps
明白了吗？

630
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:15,399
the view completely generic and allows the controller to
这种模式，就让这个视图完全变得通用起来，同时也让控制器

631
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:19,771
have complete control of this generic minion in its view.
对这个视图有完全的控制

632
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:21,472
Remember the view is the controller's minions,
还记得吗？形象地说，视图就是控制器的傀儡

633
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:23,640
it's how it's communicating with the user.
这就是它如何跟用户打交道的

634
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,243
So that's how we do it.
以上就是我们如何做的

635
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:30,580
So let's take a look at a demo of doing that in happiness.
让我们看看在 Happiness 这个 Demo 中如何做这些操作

636
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:32,348
We're going to have
首先，我们需要

637
00:27:32,349 --> 00:27:34,115
the face view delegate getting its data.
创建一个用于 faceView 来获取其数据的代理对象

638
00:27:34,118 --> 00:27:36,518
Its data is basically its smiliness,
这个数据基本上就是它的笑容程度

639
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,320
how much smileyness is going on.
笑得多灿烂的程度

640
00:27:38,322 --> 00:27:40,889
It's going to get that from the delegate.
这就是 faceView 想从这个代理对象中获取的

641
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:43,091
And, of course, the happiness view controller is going to
当然，happiness view controller 将会是

642
00:27:43,093 --> 00:27:44,358
be the delegate it gets it from.
成为它的代理，提供数据

643
00:27:45,895 --> 00:27:48,879
>> Okay.
好的

644
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,864
Well, let's now use delegation to hook up our
让我们来使用代理模式来连接

645
00:27:51,867 --> 00:27:55,701
face view to our happiness view controller.
我们的 faceView 和我们的 happiness view controller

646
00:27:56,737 --> 00:27:58,036
And we're gonna do that by
我们将会

647
00:27:58,038 --> 00:27:59,904
starting here in the face view.
从 faceView 开始

648
00:27:59,906 --> 00:28:01,606
We're gonna go through the same steps we
根据我们刚才说的流程

649
00:28:01,608 --> 00:28:05,609
just talked about in the slides to do delegation.
来创建代理的关系

650
00:28:05,611 --> 00:28:09,146
So remember the first step is that we need a protocol,
还记得第一个方法吗？首先我们需要一个协议

651
00:28:09,148 --> 00:28:13,116
some particular way that the face view is going to talk to
一些具体的方式，让我们的 faceView 与

652
00:28:13,118 --> 00:28:16,285
whoever's going to provide its data, and
任何一个可以提供数据的对象进行沟通

653
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:19,555
the face view's data is really it's smiliness.
这里的数据就是笑容的灿烂度

654
00:28:19,557 --> 00:28:20,989
So the face view has this data.
现在 faceView 已经有这个数据了

655
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,258
Now this is a very, very simple data.
这个非常简单的常量

656
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,360
Probably in real life if this weren't,
或许在实际中这个并不是一个简单的常量

657
00:28:25,362 --> 00:28:28,796
you know a demo where I'm trying to show you delegation,
但是，这里毕竟只是一个演示代理模式的 Demo

658
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:31,565
you would probably just set this, you
你可以就简单设置成一个常量

659
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:34,935
can't own it's own data, it's such a simple piece of data.
你不能拥有这个数据，它非常简单

660
00:28:34,937 --> 00:28:36,203
But we're going to use delegation to
但我们将会使用代理来

661
00:28:36,205 --> 00:28:39,072
get this piece of data here.
获得这里的数据

662
00:28:39,074 --> 00:28:41,974
Rather than have it be set right here.
而不是直接在这里设值

663
00:28:41,976 --> 00:28:44,360
All right, so
好的

664
00:28:44,361 --> 00:28:46,745
we need some sort of protocol that gets this smiliness from
所以， 我们需要一些协议，来从某些对象中获取我的笑容程度

665
00:28:46,748 --> 00:28:51,083
someone and, so we're gonna type in here protocol and
这里我们输入 protocol

666
00:28:51,085 --> 00:28:53,351
I'm gonna call this protocol.
这里我打算叫这个协议为

667
00:28:53,353 --> 00:28:58,522
That I'm developing my face view data source protocol.
因为这里我正在做的是我的 faceView 的数据来源协议，所以叫 FaceViewDataSource

668
00:28:59,692 --> 00:29:04,027
And sometimes we call these delegation protocols delegate.
通常我们将代理类型的协议后缀名起为 Delegate

669
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:05,795
Like face view delegate.
类似于 FaceViewDelegate

670
00:29:05,797 --> 00:29:08,864
But when the only purpose of the protocol is to
但这里这个协议唯一的作用就是

671
00:29:08,866 --> 00:29:11,633
get the data that the view is going to draw.
获得这个视图用来绘制的一些数据

672
00:29:11,635 --> 00:29:14,269
Because the view can't own its own data,
因为这个视图不能拥有这个数据

673
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:17,972
then we often will call the protocol datasource.
通常这种情况，我们称这种协议为 DataSource

674
00:29:19,142 --> 00:29:21,375
So this just needs to have whatever functions and
所以。这里需要的就是

675
00:29:21,377 --> 00:29:24,511
properties are required to get this used data.
用来获取数据的一些必需的函数和属性

676
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,447
Well such a simple view that it
这里，这么一个简单的视图

677
00:29:27,449 --> 00:29:32,218
just needs something to get the smile in some function so
只需要一个用来获取笑容灿烂度的函数

678
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,021
I'm going to say smiliness for face view.
这里我输入 smilinessForFaceView

679
00:29:36,023 --> 00:29:38,523
I have an argument here which is the sender.
这里有一个参数，也就是 sender

680
00:29:38,525 --> 00:29:39,891
Face view.
FaceView

681
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:41,258
And this is gonna be myself.
这里会是这个控制器自身

682
00:29:41,261 --> 00:29:44,362
So when I ask somebody else to provide my data by
当我要求其他的对象来提供我的数据的时候

683
00:29:44,364 --> 00:29:45,463
sending them this message.
我发送这个消息

684
00:29:45,465 --> 00:29:48,032
I'm gonna pass myself, this face view,
我将传入 self，这个FaceView

685
00:29:48,034 --> 00:29:49,433
along as an argument.
作为其参数

686
00:29:49,435 --> 00:29:53,336
And you'll see all throughout iOS when they have
你在 iOS 开发中会看到

687
00:29:53,338 --> 00:29:55,604
a delegate or a data source.
当某个对象拥有一个 Delegate 或者 DataSouce 的时候

688
00:29:55,606 --> 00:29:58,173
They are always going to pass themselves along.
他们都会传入他们自身

689
00:29:58,175 --> 00:30:00,709
If you are trying to provide the smiliness for
如果你尝试给这个 FaceView 提供笑容的灿烂度的时候

690
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:03,678
this FaceView, you have a point or two to FaceView.
你将这个参数指向 FaceView

691
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,913
You know, which FaceView is asking you that, and
你知道的，这个 FaceView 要求你这个

692
00:30:05,915 --> 00:30:08,115
maybe if you need to ask the FaceView some other
当然也许你也可以要求 FaceView 其他的问题

693
00:30:08,117 --> 00:30:11,318
questions to answer this, you can do that.
来回答这个，当然你可以这么做

694
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,987
Now, this smiliness what is it going to return?
现在，这个 smiliness 方法，它会返回什么呢？

695
00:30:13,989 --> 00:30:15,822
Now I'm going to have it return a double,
我想让它返回一个 Double

696
00:30:15,824 --> 00:30:17,457
which is going to be that smiliness,
也就是笑容的灿烂度

697
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:22,861
remember that smiliness goes from a plus 1 down to minus 1,
还记得笑容的灿烂度从-1到+1吗？

698
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,129
plus 1 that's very smiley and
+1代表很开心

699
00:30:24,131 --> 00:30:29,400
minus 1 that's very frowny and so we made that double.
-1代表很不开心，我们设置它为 Double

700
00:30:29,402 --> 00:30:33,404
I'm also going to make this double be an optional.
同时，我将设置它为一个可选的 Double

701
00:30:33,406 --> 00:30:36,607
And that's because if the data source, if I ask it for
那是因为，它作为一个 DataSource，如果我问

702
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:39,360
the smiliness, and for
它要灿烂度的时候

703
00:30:39,361 --> 00:30:42,112
some reason it can't provide that smiliness, then I'm gonna
因为某些的原因，它无法提供相应的值

704
00:30:42,114 --> 00:30:47,083
allow them to return nill, and just have no smile or
那么我允许它们返回 nil，也就是说

705
00:30:47,085 --> 00:30:52,020
no frown, just flatlined mouth there.
既不是开心也不是不开心，一条线的嘴巴

706
00:30:52,022 --> 00:30:55,056
Now we only by the way pass one argument here.
这里我们只传入了一个参数

707
00:30:55,058 --> 00:30:57,859
But we could definitely, if we were asking our data source,
但是我们完全可以，如果我们在请求我们的 DataSource 的时候

708
00:30:57,861 --> 00:31:00,828
we could have some more arguments in here.
可以使用多个参数

709
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:03,297
And so that's perfectly reasonable.
而且这么做也是完全合理的

710
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:04,598
You can have as many arguments as you
你为了从 DataSource 中获取这个笑容的灿烂度，需要多少个

711
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,134
need to get this smiliness out of the data source.
参数都可以

712
00:31:08,136 --> 00:31:11,637
Okay, so that's step one, we have this data source here.
好的，这就是步骤一，我们这里已经有了 DataSource

713
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:17,676
Step two is we need to have a public var in our face view,
第二步是，我们需要在我们的 FaceView 中有一个公开的变量

714
00:31:17,678 --> 00:31:19,878
which I'm going to call dataSource, and
这里我将称之为 dataSource

715
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,348
it's going to be of type FaceViewDataSource.
它的类型是 FaceViewDataSource

716
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,450
Okay?
明白了吗？

717
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:27,551
I'm going to make that an optional as well.
同样我这里会把它的类型变成可选的

718
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:30,421
So you can see here that I'm using FaceViewDataSource,
这里你可以看到，我将 FaceViewDataSource

719
00:31:30,423 --> 00:31:33,590
which is this protocol, just as a type.
这个协议，作为一个类型

720
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:34,691
And what this means is,
这代表的是

721
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:37,093
somebody who wants to provide my data,
某个对象想要提供给我数据

722
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:39,128
who wants to be my dataSource,
也就是想成为我的 dataSource

723
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:43,265
all they need to do is set themselves as this variable.
那么，它们仅仅是需要将它们自身设置为这个变量的值

724
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:46,702
And then I'm going to talk to them through this variable to
接着，我可以通过这个变量来向它们发送消息

725
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:47,769
call this function on them.
来调用它们的某些函数

726
00:31:48,805 --> 00:31:50,405
Okay?
明白了吗？

727
00:31:50,406 --> 00:31:52,006
Now, why did I make this an optional here?
为什么这里我让它变成一个可选类型呢？

728
00:31:52,008 --> 00:31:54,575
Because it's possible that
因为有可能

729
00:31:54,577 --> 00:31:56,243
I can just live without a data source.
我们的 FaceView 并没有一个 dataSource

730
00:31:56,245 --> 00:31:58,578
I will just always have a flat line, a flat mouth.
那么在这种的情况下，FaceView 的嘴巴始终是一条直线

731
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,814
I won't be smiling or frowning.
既不微笑也不伤心

732
00:32:01,816 --> 00:32:04,450
And so this can be allowed to be nil.
所以 dataSource 可以允许是 nil

733
00:32:04,452 --> 00:32:07,686
Okay, now normally, this is not going to want to be nil,
通常，我们不想让它是 nil

734
00:32:07,688 --> 00:32:11,489
because we don't want a face with no frown and no smile.
因为我们不希望看到一个既不微笑也不伤心的脸

735
00:32:11,491 --> 00:32:14,425
But, we'll certainly allow it.
我跟你们说的意思是，这里完全可以这么做（不提供 dataSource）

736
00:32:14,427 --> 00:32:15,760
So, allow that there.

737
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,896
Now one other thing we have to do about this data source here
现在，我们还要继续对 dataSource 做的一件事情是

738
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:23,867
is we really want to describe it as weak.
声明它是一个 weak 类型的

739
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:26,703
Now this is gonna be the first time we talk about
这将成为我们讨论内存管理的第一堂课

740
00:32:26,705 --> 00:32:28,637
memory management in this class.

741
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:29,972
And really the memory's just been
事实上，内存是被操作系统

742
00:32:29,974 --> 00:32:32,140
managed automatically for you.
自动管理的，所以你不用担心

743
00:32:32,142 --> 00:32:33,375
But here we have to be a little bit
但是我们需要注意的是

744
00:32:33,377 --> 00:32:36,811
careful with the memory management of this pointer.
对这个指针的内存管理

745
00:32:36,813 --> 00:32:38,930
Because, for example,
因为，例如

746
00:32:38,931 --> 00:32:41,048
our controller is going to set itself as the data source.
我们的控制器将会设置它自身为 dataSource

747
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:44,418
So it's going to set this pointer back to itself because
然后它将设置这个指针为自身

748
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,721
our controller's going to be a FaceViewDataSource.
因为我们的控制器将会成为一个 FaceViewDataSource

749
00:32:47,723 --> 00:32:50,657
And, unfortunately, the controller also has
不幸的是，我们的控制器

750
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:54,127
a pointer to this FaceView through the view hierarchy.
在视图的层次上已经有一个指向 FaceView 的指针了

751
00:32:54,129 --> 00:32:57,296
Because it's gonna have some outlet to the face view, and
因为它有一个链接到 FaceView 的 outlet

752
00:32:57,298 --> 00:32:59,465
so they'll be pointing to each other.
这样，这两个对象就互相指向了对方

753
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:02,668
And since they're pointing to each other they're keeping
那么在这个时候，它们

754
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,669
each other in memory at all times, so
就会一直在内存中相互引用对方，形成一个圈

755
00:33:04,671 --> 00:33:07,605
that kinda memory cycle is really bad.
在内存中出现这样的圈是很可怕的

756
00:33:07,607 --> 00:33:09,607
Because then the FaceView and
因为 FaceView

757
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:11,508
the controller can never leave memory.
和控制器都无法释放其的内存

758
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,011
They'll be stuck in memory forever.
它们就会永远呆在了内存中

759
00:33:14,013 --> 00:33:17,681
So, by making this weak, if we put weak in front of a var
但是，通过在变量之前声明这个为 weak

760
00:33:17,683 --> 00:33:24,320
pointer it means that this pointer, this thing, whatever
这个的意思是，这个对象，无论它

761
00:33:24,322 --> 00:33:30,225
this points to, should not be used to keep it in memory.
指向的是什么东西，这个东西都不应该被用于在内存中保留它

762
00:33:30,227 --> 00:33:32,794
So the controller is gonna set itself as this data source.
也就是说，控制器将会设置它自身为 dataSource

763
00:33:32,796 --> 00:33:35,229
This pointer, since it is going to be a weak pointer,
这个指针，既然它声明了自己是一个 weak 指针

764
00:33:35,231 --> 00:33:36,864
is not going to keep the controller in memory.
将不会在内存中保存这个控制器

765
00:33:36,866 --> 00:33:38,932
So the controller will be allowed to go out of memory.
所以，这个控制器被允许从内存中释放

766
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,033
And when it goes out of memory,
当它被释放的时候

767
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:41,601
of course the FaceView loss will go out of
当然 FaceView 也会同样从内存中释放

768
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,803
memory with it because its entire view hierarchy,
因为 FaceView 在控制器的视图层次中

769
00:33:43,805 --> 00:33:48,340
the controller's view hierarchy will go out as well.
而控制器的视图层次会随控制器一起被释放掉

770
00:33:48,342 --> 00:33:51,643
And now you can see that we have an error here, okay?
现在你看到这里有一个错误

771
00:33:51,645 --> 00:33:55,079
And this error says weak cannot be applied to non-class
这个错误说，weak 类型不能应用在非类的类型上

772
00:33:55,081 --> 00:33:56,280
types, okay?
明白了吗？

773
00:33:56,282 --> 00:34:00,250
So FaceViewDataSource is a protocol, not a class.
FaceViewDataSource 是一个协议，而不是一个类

774
00:34:00,252 --> 00:34:02,185
So FaceViewDataSource could be an enum or
所以我们需要把 FaceViewDataSource 改成枚举类型

775
00:34:02,187 --> 00:34:05,922
a struct and that's a problem because we really need this to
或者结构体，因为我们希望这个变量是 weak 类型的

776
00:34:05,924 --> 00:34:07,957
be weak because we
我们不希望

777
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:09,991
don't want that cycle things pointing back to each other.
在内存中出现两个对象互相指向对方的环

778
00:34:09,994 --> 00:34:12,828
So, we can actually make FaceViewDataSource, even
所以我们要讲 FaceViewDataSource

779
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,430
though it's a protocol, we can make it be a class type.
变成一个类，尽管它只是一个协议

780
00:34:15,432 --> 00:34:17,766
If you remember from the slides in our
如果你还记得 Slide 中的

781
00:34:17,768 --> 00:34:21,502
protocol declaration, we can say colon class.
协议声明的话，我们可以通过在协议后面加上 : class 来让它变成一个类

782
00:34:21,504 --> 00:34:24,372
And that says that FaceViewDataSource can only be
这代表的是，FaceViewDataSource 只能被一个类所实现

783
00:34:24,374 --> 00:34:27,307
implemented by a class, it cannot be implemented by
它不能被一个枚举类型或者一个结构体所实现

784
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:30,477
a struct or an enum, and that's perfectly fine and
这是完全没有问题的

785
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:33,046
usually that's what we're going to want anyway, but
同样也是我们所希望的

786
00:34:33,048 --> 00:34:35,815
we definitely need that so we can have this weak behavior.
因为我们想让这个变量为 weak

787
00:34:35,817 --> 00:34:38,751
So this data source, the pointer it has to whatever its
那么， 这个 dataSource，任何它指向的对象

788
00:34:38,753 --> 00:34:41,053
data source will not keep it's data source in memory.
都不会被保存在 dataSource 的内存中了

789
00:34:42,523 --> 00:34:45,090
As long as the dataSource is in memory,
只要是 dataSource 在内存中

790
00:34:45,092 --> 00:34:47,209
this pointer will be good.
那么这个指针就不会有问题

791
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,327
As soon as the dataSource goes out of memory then this
一旦 dataSource 从内存中释放了

792
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:52,697
pointer will be set to nill automatically by the system.
那么这个指针将会被系统自动设成 nil

793
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,965
So it's pretty cool, these banners are pretty cool.
这非常酷

794
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,734
We don't use them a lot you saw that we used them for IB
平时我们不会经常使用到 weak，但是我们看到在 IBOutlet

795
00:34:57,736 --> 00:35:00,303
outlets and this is the second place that we have used them,
里 weak 被大量使用到，这里

796
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:02,038
which is for delegation.
代理，是第二个被大量使用到的地方

797
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,707
We're always gonna use a weak var when we have delegation.
如果我们有一个代理的时候，我们始终需要一个 weak 类型的变量

798
00:35:04,709 --> 00:35:05,274
Okay?
明白了吗？

799
00:35:06,243 --> 00:35:08,943
That just requires that we make our protocol,
那仅仅要求我们使得 protocol，

800
00:35:08,945 --> 00:35:10,378
you only work for classes.
只对 class 类型起作用。

801
00:35:11,547 --> 00:35:12,446
All right?
明白了？

802
00:35:12,448 --> 00:35:13,964
Okay? So now we
现在我们

803
00:35:13,965 --> 00:35:15,481
have this nice data source right here.
有了个不错的 dataSource。

804
00:35:15,484 --> 00:35:18,018
Let's go ahead and go to the next step,
我们继续到下一步，

805
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:20,553
which to use the data source to get our smiliness, right?
处理谁来使用这个 dataSource 得到 smiliness，对吗？

806
00:35:20,555 --> 00:35:22,355
So we have our smiliness right here,
于是我们在这里得到了 smiliness，

807
00:35:22,357 --> 00:35:26,058
it's currently at constant minus 0.5, so we're going to
现在是常量-0.5，所以我们要

808
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,093
get it from the data source by just saying to the data
从 dataSource 里获取，简单告诉 dataSource，

809
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:32,664
source, please give us our smiliness for FaceView Self.
请把 FaceView self 的 smiliness 给我们。

810
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:34,865
Okay?

811
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:36,100
Now when I type that in,
现在当我输入的时候，

812
00:35:36,102 --> 00:35:38,035
Swift automatically put this question mark here.
Swift 自动把"?"放在这里。

813
00:35:38,037 --> 00:35:39,035
I didn't type that.
我没有输入它。

814
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:40,503
It put it in here.
它把它放在这里。

815
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,872
Why did it put here?
为什么在这里？

816
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:45,240
Well it put it here because data source is an optional.
因为 dataSource 是 optional。
819
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,543
And it could be nil, okay?
它可能值为 nil，okay？

817
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,678
This is an optional, it could be nil.
这是个 optional，可以是 nil。

818
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,681
And so Swift is assuming that we wanna use optional
所以 Swift 假设我们想要在这里使用

819
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,015
chaining here.
optional 链。

820
00:35:54,017 --> 00:35:57,618
And just, if this is nil, then this whole rest of
如果这是 nil，那么剩下所有的

821
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,153
this expression is gonna be ignored.
表达式都将被忽略。

822
00:35:59,155 --> 00:36:00,854
This whole thing would be nil.
整体的值将是 nil。

823
00:36:00,856 --> 00:36:03,923
And smiliness here would be set to nil, okay?
这里 smiliness 将会被设置为 nil，okay？

824
00:36:03,925 --> 00:36:06,225
But smiliness, you can see this error here is
不过 smiliness，你会在这里看到这个 error

825
00:36:06,227 --> 00:36:08,327
because smiliness, it can't be nil.
是因为 smiliness，它不能为 nil。

826
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:09,995
It has to be a double.
它必须是 double。

827
00:36:09,997 --> 00:36:12,431
So we're going to use another cool little feature switch.
所以我们要使用另一个酷酷的小特性转换。

828
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:15,600
Swift which is the question mark question mark operator.
Swift 的 ?? 操作符。

829
00:36:15,602 --> 00:36:17,735
Now what this operator says is,
这个操作符的意思是，

830
00:36:17,737 --> 00:36:21,238
if the thing on the left-hand side of the question mark
如果操作符左侧的表达式

831
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,275
question mark is not nill, then use that.
不是 nil，那么以它为值。

832
00:36:25,277 --> 00:36:28,779
But if it is nil, then use what's on the righthand side,
如果左侧表达式为 nil，那么使用右侧的表达式，

833
00:36:28,781 --> 00:36:32,048
and to the right hand side I'm gonna put 0.0.
在右侧我放上0.0。

834
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:37,687
So what that says is that if the data source is nil,
它的意思是如果 dataSource 是 nil，

835
00:36:37,689 --> 00:36:39,955
then we're going to use smiliness of 0,
那么我们将使用0为 smiliness 的值，

836
00:36:39,957 --> 00:36:42,090
which is not a frown or a smile, it's in the middle.
它不是皱眉也不是微笑，它正好处在中间。

837
00:36:43,226 --> 00:36:45,426
Now this is also gonna be working if
这也会在

838
00:36:45,428 --> 00:36:48,796
smilinessForFaceView happens to return nil because you
smilinessForFaceView 正好返回 nil 时起作用

839
00:36:48,798 --> 00:36:52,599
remember it is also an optional double right here.
因为你记得，它也是个 optinal double。

840
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:54,968
So that'll work perfectly fine there as well.
所以这里处理得非常好。

841
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,703
So whether this returns nil or
所以无论是这里返回 nil

842
00:36:56,705 --> 00:37:00,406
whether this is nil, invalidating the rest of this,
还是这里是 nil，使得这里剩下的都无效，

843
00:37:00,408 --> 00:37:01,741
we're gonna get no smile or frown.
我们将得不到笑脸或者皱眉。

844
00:37:01,743 --> 00:37:06,912
So this is a cool little operator [INAUDIBLE].
所以这是个酷酷的小操作符。

845
00:37:06,914 --> 00:37:09,681
Okay, so we've got our face view doing its part.
Okay，所以我们让 FaceView 干好了它的活。

846
00:37:09,683 --> 00:37:11,749
It's declaring this nice property,
它在这里声明了这个漂亮的 property，

847
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:13,417
this protocol right here.
这个 protocol。

848
00:37:13,419 --> 00:37:16,854
It's got a property which less people set themselves as
它有个让别人把他们设置为

849
00:37:16,856 --> 00:37:18,055
the data source and
dataSource 然后

850
00:37:18,057 --> 00:37:21,224
then it uses that data source to get its smiliness.
使用 dataSource 获得 smiliness 的 property。

851
00:37:21,226 --> 00:37:23,226
All right, so
好了，所以

852
00:37:23,227 --> 00:37:25,227
now let's go back to our happiness view controller.
现在让我们回到 HappinessViewController。

853
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,228
Okay? The controller has to
这个 controller 必须

854
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,664
implement the other side of delegation.
实现 delegation 的另一面。

855
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:30,932
Now you remember one of the steps it has is it has to
你们记住有一个步骤是，它必须

856
00:37:30,934 --> 00:37:34,302
say to the world, I am HappinessViewController and
对世界宣布，我是 HappinessViewController

857
00:37:34,304 --> 00:37:38,072
I implement the FaceViewDataSource protocol.
我会实现 FaceViewDataSource protocol。

858
00:37:38,074 --> 00:37:41,709
And it does that by just saying FaceViewDataSource.
声明 FaceViewDataSource 就完成了这些。

859
00:37:41,711 --> 00:37:43,344
Now as soon as I put this on here,
一旦我把它放在这里，

860
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:44,811
I'm going to get a warning right here,
我会得到一个 warning，

861
00:37:44,813 --> 00:37:46,863
an error that says,
一个 error 说，

862
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,914
HappinessViewController does not conform to that protocol.
HappinessViewController 没有遵从那个 protocol.

863
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:51,918
And indeed it doesn't because we do not implement
实际上也没有，因为我们还没有

864
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,787
that smiliness by anywhere in our class.
在我们的 class 里实现 smiliness。

865
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:56,355
So, easily fixed though.
所以，简单地搞定它。

866
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,458
We go down here, now, since, we've already told it,
我们往下到这里，我们已经说过了，

867
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,376
it implements this.
它会实现这个。

868
00:38:01,377 --> 00:38:03,293
If I just start typing smiliness it's going to
如果我开始输入 smiliness， 它会

869
00:38:03,296 --> 00:38:05,530
automatically know to escape complete.
自动提示完成。

870
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:07,064
So I'll hit Tab.
所以我点击 Tab 键，

871
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:09,166
I've got my nice method here.
我就在这里得到了我的 method。

872
00:38:09,168 --> 00:38:13,570
So how am I going to implement this protocol?
所以我如何实现这个 protocal？

873
00:38:13,572 --> 00:38:15,571
Okay, this method in this protocol,
Okay，这个 protocol 的 method，

874
00:38:15,573 --> 00:38:17,273
how am I going to implement that?
我怎么实现呢？

875
00:38:17,275 --> 00:38:21,476
Well the happiness view controller is going to
好吧，HappinessViewController 要

876
00:38:21,478 --> 00:38:23,812
interpret the happiness here.
在这里解析 happiness。

877
00:38:23,814 --> 00:38:25,213
Which is the model.
这里是 model 层。

878
00:38:25,214 --> 00:38:26,613
This is the happiness view controller's model.
这是 HappinessViewController 的 model。

879
00:38:26,616 --> 00:38:30,718
It's gonna interpret this for the view, because the view
它要为 view 解析这些，因为 view

880
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,487
doesn't know about happiness, it only knows about smiliness.
不知道 happiness，它只知道 smiliness。

881
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:35,956
Smiliness goes from 1 to minus 1.
smiliness 的值介于-1到1之间。

882
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:38,792
Here, we're taking about the model which is happiness that
这里，我们讨论 model 层也就是 happiness，

883
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:40,226
goes from 0 to 100.
值介于0到100.

884
00:38:40,228 --> 00:38:43,162
So it's a typical job of the controller to
所以这是个典型的 controller 的任务

885
00:38:43,164 --> 00:38:46,965
interpret the model for the view.
为 view 解析 model。

886
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:48,734
You also interpret the view for the model and we'll see
你也会为了 model 解析 view，我们

887
00:38:48,736 --> 00:38:51,536
that a little bit later when we talk about gestures.
待会儿讨论手势的时候再作说明。

888
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:55,006
But, here we're going to interpret the model for
但是，这里我们要解析 model 来

889
00:38:55,008 --> 00:38:56,841
the view.
绘制 view。

890
00:38:56,842 --> 00:38:58,675
So, I'm just going to return.
所以，我要返回。

891
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:04,047
Now, happiness is an int, and smiliness is a double, so
现在，happiness 是 int，smiliness 是 double，

892
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:06,916
I am going to have to convert the happiness.
所以我必须转化 happiness。

893
00:39:07,952 --> 00:39:11,653
Also, the happiness is on a scale of 0 to 100, so
同样，happiness 是0到100之间的一个标量，

894
00:39:11,655 --> 00:39:14,088
I am going to do minus 50.
所以我要减去50.

895
00:39:15,158 --> 00:39:18,192
Divide by 50 to convert it into that plus 1 to
再除以50把它转化到

896
00:39:18,194 --> 00:39:19,626
minus 1 scale.
1到-1之间。

897
00:39:19,628 --> 00:39:22,762
So here I'm just interpreting the model for the view.
所以这里我刚刚为 view 解析了 model。

898
00:39:23,998 --> 00:39:25,197
Make sense?
听懂了吗？

899
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:27,399
Now the last thing that needs to happen here is
现在这里最后一件事

900
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:30,669
that the controller needs to set itself
是 controller 需要把自己

901
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:35,773
as the data source of the FaceView.
设置为 FaceView 的 dataSource。

902
00:39:35,775 --> 00:39:36,807
Let's all go back to FaceView,
让我们回到 FaceView，

903
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:38,575
I'm going to show you a nice trick here.
这里我要给你们展示一个技巧。

904
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:43,946
Cmd+Shift+O will let you type in like, start typing
Cmd+Shift+O 让你们这么输入，开始输入

905
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,215
FaceView and you can see it appear right there, and
"FaceView" 然后你会发现它出现在那，

906
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:50,285
you can switch really quick so Cmd+Shift+O is a great way to
你能非常快速地切换。所以 Cmd+Shift+O 是非常棒的

907
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:54,923
switch really quickly between files in your project.
在工程里快速切换文件的方式。

908
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:59,093
All right, so we need to set this data source right here
好了，我们需要在这里设置我们的 FaceView 的 dataSource

909
00:39:59,095 --> 00:40:01,895
inside of our face view to be the controller.
为这个 controller。

910
00:40:02,964 --> 00:40:04,497
So for the controller to do that,
所以 controller 为了做这些，

911
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:08,200
though, it needs to have a pointer to the FaceView.
它需要一个指向 FaceView 的 pointer。

912
00:40:08,202 --> 00:40:09,702
And we do pointers to things in
我们在 view 里用 outlets

913
00:40:09,704 --> 00:40:13,071
our view using outlets, right?
来实现指向事物的 pointer，对吗？

914
00:40:13,073 --> 00:40:18,209
So let's go over here to our storyboard and wire up
所以我们来到 storyboard 这里

915
00:40:18,211 --> 00:40:20,111
an outlet from this.
从这里引出一个 outlet。

916
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:21,679
We'll go to automatic mode up here.
我们来到 automatic 模式这里。

917
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:23,413
Remember, when you go to automatic mode you're
记住，当你进入 automatic 模式你会

918
00:40:23,415 --> 00:40:26,249
gonna see the controller that matches what you
看到一些 controller

919
00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:27,650
have selected in your storyboard.
这些 controller 跟你在 storyboard 里选择的控件有关。

920
00:40:29,387 --> 00:40:31,186
So here we can have that.
所以这里我们能看到它。

921
00:40:31,188 --> 00:40:34,589
So I'm just going to take my controller right here and
所以我要在这里选择我的 controller

922
00:40:34,591 --> 00:40:37,058
I'm going to Ctrl+drag to create an outlet.
同时 Ctrl+拖拽 创建一个 outlet。

923
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:41,028
This is the same way that I create an outlet to buttons or
这种方式和为 button 或者

924
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,529
to the labels or whatever we've done.
label 创建 outlet 的方式一摸一样。

925
00:40:42,531 --> 00:40:43,296
It's exactly the same.
完全一样。

926
00:40:43,298 --> 00:40:44,931
It's just a normal outlet.
这是个普通的 outlet。

927
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:48,067
I'm going to call it Face View.
我把它命名为 faceView

928
00:40:49,103 --> 00:40:52,037
So here's really nice FaceView right there.
于是那里有个不错的 Faceview。

929
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:55,473
Now where in my code should I go and
现在我在代码的哪里

930
00:40:55,475 --> 00:40:58,843
set this var right here?
设置这个变量呢？

931
00:40:58,845 --> 00:41:00,277
Okay, this data source var.
Okay，这个 dataSource 变量。

932
00:41:00,279 --> 00:41:03,914
Well a great place to do it since this is
好吧，一个合理的位置 (既然这是那个

933
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:05,716
the faceView we want to set that in,
要被设置的 faceView）

934
00:41:05,718 --> 00:41:11,554
is right here in the property observer for the FaceView.
就是在这里，FaceView 的 property observer。

935
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:15,124
This property observer is called when the iOS starts up
这个 property observer 会在 iOS 启动

936
00:41:15,126 --> 00:41:16,725
and loads the story board.
并加载这个 storyboard 时调用。

937
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:18,360
It connects this outlet.
它连接这个 outlet。

938
00:41:18,362 --> 00:41:21,029
It's going to set this variable.
然后设置这个变量。

939
00:41:21,031 --> 00:41:23,998
And so it's a perfect time when this is
所以这是个完美的时刻

940
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,399
being set to go ahead and
当这个变量被设置继续前行

941
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:30,103
say FaceView.dataSource equals self, okay?
然后设置 faceView.dataSource = self, okay?

942
00:41:30,105 --> 00:41:31,504
This is the controller.
这是 controller。

943
00:41:31,506 --> 00:41:33,990
It's perfectly legal for
对它来说这么干完全合法，

944
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,475
it to say this because it is a FaceView data source, right?
因为它是 FaceView 的 dataSource，对吗？

945
00:41:36,478 --> 00:41:38,911
The happiness view controller is a face view data source so
HappinessViewController 是 FaceView 的 dataSource

946
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,547
we can say that it is the new source.
所以我们说它是新的来源。

947
00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:42,714
It's perfectly fine equals.
它是非常好的等价物。

948
00:41:42,716 --> 00:41:45,016
All right?
对吗？

949
00:41:45,018 --> 00:41:46,784
That make sense that we're doing that?
明白我们这么做的意义了吗？

950
00:41:48,087 --> 00:41:50,087
Okay, so now everything is hooked,
Okay，现在一切都组装好了，

951
00:41:50,089 --> 00:41:52,422
and how is this gonna work.
这是怎么工作的。

952
00:41:52,424 --> 00:41:55,391
It's going to be very straight forward.
非常直接。

953
00:41:56,561 --> 00:41:59,828
Every time that the face redraws itself,
每次 face 重绘自身的时候，

954
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:03,265
it's going to look for its data source.
它会去查找自己的 dataSource。

955
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:06,634
Which we have set right here in our controller to
也就是我们在 controller 这里设置的

956
00:42:06,636 --> 00:42:07,869
be the controller itself.
controller 自身。

957
00:42:09,038 --> 00:42:11,438
It's going to get its smiliness from the data
它会从 dataSource

958
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,975
source by calling the method in the protocol up here, okay?
通过调用上面 protocol 里的 method， 来获得 smiliness，okay？

959
00:42:15,977 --> 00:42:18,478
We implement that method in our controller.
我们在 controller 里实现了对应的 method。

960
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,813
We interpret the model for the view.
我们为 view 解析 model。

961
00:42:20,815 --> 00:42:22,815
And the FaceView's gonna be able to draw the proper value.
然后 FaceView 就会绘制出用合适的值。

962
00:42:22,817 --> 00:42:26,885
Now there's only one other thing that I wanna do here.
现在这里只剩下一件我要做的事了。

963
00:42:26,887 --> 00:42:29,120
Which is every time something changes our model,
也就是每次我们的model变动时，

964
00:42:29,122 --> 00:42:30,922
I wanna make sure the face redraws itself.
我要让 face 重新绘制自身。

965
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:35,993
Of course, because we're representing that in the face.
这是当然的，因为我们要在 face 中表现出来。

966
00:42:35,995 --> 00:42:39,363
So the best space to do that is in this update UI, so
所以做这个的最佳的位置是 UpdateUI

967
00:42:39,365 --> 00:42:42,899
every single time the happiness changes I'm going to
每一次 happiness 值变动了

968
00:42:42,901 --> 00:42:48,304
ask my faceView to set needs display of itself.
我都会让 faceView 设置 setNeedsDisplay.

969
00:42:48,306 --> 00:42:50,272
In other words, to redraw.
换句话说，重绘。

970
00:42:50,274 --> 00:42:53,141
Remember set needs display is the thing you do that says
记住，setNeedsDisplay 就是那种

971
00:42:53,143 --> 00:42:55,744
hey, call my draw rect, redraw me.
“hey，调用我的 drawRect 函数，重绘我”的意思

972
00:42:55,746 --> 00:42:57,111
Now if I didn't do this then every time I
现在如果我没有做这个，那么每次

973
00:42:57,113 --> 00:42:59,680
set my happiness the FaceView would not draw, okay?
我设置 happiness， faceView都不会重新绘制，okay？

974
00:42:59,682 --> 00:43:02,716
Now maybe if I rotated my device and
现在可能是因为我旋转了我的设备

975
00:43:02,718 --> 00:43:06,519
it redrew then it would show it but.
然后它重新绘制显示出来了。

976
00:43:07,622 --> 00:43:12,024
Otherwise it wasn't gonna show it.
否则它不会显示出来。

977
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:14,426
We've got this hooked up, it really should be the happiness
我们把这个关联上了，它应该是真正的

978
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:17,495
that's showing in here rather than the smiliness.
显示在这里的 happiness 而不是 smiliness。

979
00:43:17,497 --> 00:43:19,731
So it shouldn't be a flat line right here,
所以它不该是这样一条水平的线段。

980
00:43:19,733 --> 00:43:21,432
it should actually show the happiness.
它应该实际展示 happiness。

981
00:43:21,434 --> 00:43:24,435
Let's go ahead run, see what we got here.
我们运行一下，看看效果如何。

982
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,207
I knew we should get a happiness of 75,
我们应该得到一个75的 happiness。

983
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:34,243
which is a little bit happy.
有一点点的 happy。

984
00:43:34,245 --> 00:43:36,078
Yeah. That looks good right there.
好的。看上去挺不错。

985
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,048
Let's go change our happiness here to be sad, like maybe 10.
我们把 happiness 改成悲伤，比如说10.

986
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:41,716
Go ahead and re-run.
重新运行。

987
00:43:44,053 --> 00:43:48,588
Okay, we're sad, all right and
Okay，我们是悲伤的，好了

988
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:55,995
let's go to the ecstatic and we're ecstatic, okay?
我们展示一下狂喜，我们是狂喜的，okay？

989
00:43:55,997 --> 00:43:57,863
Or we should be ecstatic because we
或者我们应该是狂喜的，因为

990
00:43:57,865 --> 00:44:00,198
successfully implemented delegation.
我们成功地实现了 delegation。

991
00:44:04,404 --> 00:44:06,437
>> All right.

992
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:08,471
Let's go back to our slides and
我们回到课件上

993
00:44:08,474 --> 00:44:12,109
cover the next thing here, which is gestures.
讨论下一个东西，手势。

994
00:44:13,311 --> 00:44:14,544
All right.

995
00:44:14,545 --> 00:44:15,778
So we know how to draw inner view,
所以我们知道怎么去绘制内部 view，

996
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,313
now we wanna handle these gestures.
现在我们要处理这些手势。

997
00:44:17,315 --> 00:44:19,599
Okay?

998
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,884
You know, pinches and maybe rotations, swipes, taps,
比如，pinchs，rotations，swipes，taps

999
00:44:21,886 --> 00:44:24,170
things like that.
等手势。

1000
00:44:24,171 --> 00:44:26,455
Now we could get the raw data about every finger that
我们可以获取到每个手指按下、

1001
00:44:26,457 --> 00:44:29,691
goes down, and where it is, that data is available, but
位置的原始信息，

1002
00:44:29,693 --> 00:44:31,325
we never look at that.
但是我们很少直接使用这些信息。

1003
00:44:31,327 --> 00:44:34,061
First of all it's very difficult to
因为我们自己通过这些原始信息

1004
00:44:34,063 --> 00:44:35,562
look at that raw data, and
很难判断

1005
00:44:35,564 --> 00:44:39,199
see, is this a swipe, or is it just moving over to the right.
这是一个swipe手势，还是单纯向右滑动。

1006
00:44:40,168 --> 00:44:41,534
So iOS does all that for
不过 iOS 为我们做了底层封装，

1007
00:44:41,536 --> 00:44:44,203
you, and that's the only way I'm going to teach you
而本课上，我只会教你

1008
00:44:44,205 --> 00:44:48,006
to react to user touches is via gestures, okay?
通过手势来处理用户的触摸事件，明白吗？

1009
00:44:48,008 --> 00:44:49,540
So how do gestures work?
那么手势是如何工作的呢？

1010
00:44:49,542 --> 00:44:52,677
Gestures are recognized by UI views when
当手指在视图边界内滑动时，

1011
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:56,013
the gesture happens inside their bounds.
视图会识别特定的手势。

1012
00:44:56,015 --> 00:44:58,782
Okay, I told you the views are rectangular areas where you
是的，我说过，视图是用来绘制和

1013
00:44:58,784 --> 00:45:00,450
draw and you recognize gestures so
识别手势的矩形区域

1014
00:45:00,452 --> 00:45:02,085
this is how it happens.
手势就是这样被识别的。

1015
00:45:02,087 --> 00:45:04,620
There's a class called UIGestureRecognizer.
有一个叫UIGestureRecognizer的类。

1016
00:45:04,622 --> 00:45:06,255
It's an abstract base class.
它是一个抽象类。

1017
00:45:06,257 --> 00:45:09,424
You never actually create a UIGestureRecognizer base
通常，你不会直接创建UIGestureRecognizer基类，

1018
00:45:09,426 --> 00:45:13,128
class, you create a sub class of UIGestureRecognizer.
而是创建它的子类。

1019
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,263
And those subclasses are concrete in
因为这些具体的子类

1020
00:45:15,265 --> 00:45:17,932
that they know about certain gestures, swipes and pans and
能够识别特定的手势，比如swipes、pans、touch

1021
00:45:17,934 --> 00:45:19,233
touches, et cetera.
等。

1022
00:45:19,235 --> 00:45:24,137
So there are two sides to using a gesture recognizer.
使用手势识别器有两个步骤。

1023
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:27,674
One is you have to add a gesture recognizer to a view.
首先是为视图添加手势识别器。

1024
00:45:27,676 --> 00:45:30,643
That says to the view, start recognizing this gesture.
这表示，该视图现在能识别手势。

1025
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:33,679
If you recognize this gesture, you let somebody know.
如果你识别了这个手势，就报告给某个对象。

1026
00:45:33,681 --> 00:45:34,279
Okay?
明白吗？

1027
00:45:34,281 --> 00:45:35,914
And you do that with
完成这个步骤，

1028
00:45:35,915 --> 00:45:37,548
a function on UIView called add gesture recognizer.
你只需要调用视图的addGestureRecognized方法。

1029
00:45:37,551 --> 00:45:38,950
Couldn't be simpler.
非常简单。

1030
00:45:38,952 --> 00:45:42,687
Then the second piece, though, is when you create the gesture
第二步是，当你创建手势识别器的时候，

1031
00:45:42,689 --> 00:45:46,323
recognizer, you have to say, if you recognize the gesture,
你必须指定一个对象，如果视图识别了这个手势

1032
00:45:46,325 --> 00:45:48,225
who are you gonna tell about it?
就报告给这个对象。

1033
00:45:48,227 --> 00:45:49,893
Okay, you have to notify somebody and
是的，你需要让某个对象知道

1034
00:45:49,895 --> 00:45:51,361
say oh, I recognize that swipe.
嘿，这是一个swipe手势。

1035
00:45:51,363 --> 00:45:51,961
Okay?
明白吗？

1036
00:45:51,963 --> 00:45:53,395
So there's the handler.
也就是说，你需要提供一个处理事件的对象。

1037
00:45:53,397 --> 00:45:56,365
So you've got the recognizer, that's the view.
一个是识别手势的对象，就是视图。

1038
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:58,800
Okay, the gesture recognizer in association with the view.
是的，添加了手势识别器的视图。

1039
00:45:58,802 --> 00:46:00,935
And then you've got the handler that's who handles it,
然后是处理事件的对象，

1040
00:46:00,937 --> 00:46:02,870
and those are not always the same person.
这两个并不一定是同一个对象。

1041
00:46:02,872 --> 00:46:05,506
Sometimes they're the same object, sometimes not.
有些时候是的，有些时候不是。

1042
00:46:05,508 --> 00:46:08,775
Usually the first one, adding a gesture recognizer to
通常，为视图添加识别器

1043
00:46:08,777 --> 00:46:11,211
a view is done by a controller.
是通过控制器来完成的。

1044
00:46:11,213 --> 00:46:13,646
Although a view will sometimes add it to itself, for
不过有些时候，视图自己也可以添加识别器，

1045
00:46:13,648 --> 00:46:14,914
example scroll view.
比如scroll view。

1046
00:46:14,916 --> 00:46:17,449
Scroll view doesn't even exist without the pan and
scroll view 可以自动识别

1047
00:46:17,451 --> 00:46:19,451
pinch gestures, that's what it does.
pan和pinch手势。

1048
00:46:19,453 --> 00:46:22,020
So it adds the gesture recognizers to itself.
它为自身添加了这些识别器。

1049
00:46:22,022 --> 00:46:25,189
But a lot of times other times you have a gesture that
但是大多数时候，

1050
00:46:25,191 --> 00:46:28,992
you're going to recognize only if the controller wants you to
只有在控制器需要视图识别手势的时候，

1051
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,411
recognize it, so
你才添加识别器到视图上，

1052
00:46:31,412 --> 00:46:33,829
you make some public handler possibly in your view.
你可能在视图中 实现公开的事件处理方法。

1053
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:37,233
And then your controller can add this gesture recognizer to
然后控制器可以添加识别器到

1054
00:46:37,235 --> 00:46:39,035
one of its views, one of its minions and say,
视图，

1055
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:41,804
start recognizing this gesture and you can even handle it
视图开始识别手势，甚至在手势被识别后

1056
00:46:41,806 --> 00:46:44,106
yourself if you want, the controller might say.
可以自己处理相关事件。

1057
00:46:44,108 --> 00:46:47,009
Or the controller might say oh, and I'll handle it.
又或者由控制器来处理。

1058
00:46:47,011 --> 00:46:49,778
So the second thing, the handling is either done by
所以，第二步中，如果是显示相关的事件

1059
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:53,281
the view if it's a display-oriented handling
一般由视图自己来处理，

1060
00:46:53,283 --> 00:46:56,217
thing, or it's done by the controller if it's handling
而如果涉及到修改model的时候

1061
00:46:56,219 --> 00:46:58,719
something that's going to modify the model.
事件一般由控制器来处理。

1062
00:46:58,721 --> 00:47:00,320
Okay? Or be something that's
明白吗？ 如果

1063
00:47:00,322 --> 00:47:03,623
complicated that's going to cause multiple views to
涉及很多视图这种复杂情况的时候

1064
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:05,525
be involved and so the controller has to do it.
就必须由控制器来处理了。

1065
00:47:05,527 --> 00:47:08,260
And it's perfectly fine to have either the controller or
所以，事件的处理通常都是由控制器

1066
00:47:08,262 --> 00:47:10,295
the view handle something although you would
或者视图两个中的一个来完成的，

1067
00:47:10,297 --> 00:47:13,665
never have the view handle a gesture that is directly
你绝不会在视图中直接

1068
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,633
modifying the model cuz a view can't see the model.
修改model，因为model对view是不可见的。

1069
00:47:15,635 --> 00:47:17,635
Only a controller can do that.
只有控制器可以直接和model交互。

1070
00:47:18,838 --> 00:47:20,871
Okay?
明白吗？

1071
00:47:20,872 --> 00:47:22,905
So how do you add a gesture recognizer to a UI view?
那么，怎样为视图添加识别器呢？

1072
00:47:22,908 --> 00:47:24,274
It's very simple.
非常简单。

1073
00:47:24,276 --> 00:47:27,310
I'm going to do it in a way that is very common, which is
我会用一种很通用的方式，

1074
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:31,147
to do it in the property observer of an outlet setter,
就是在属性监听的set方法中来完成，

1075
00:47:31,149 --> 00:47:34,784
just exactly like we did when we set the face views delegate
就和我们在设置face view代理一样

1076
00:47:34,786 --> 00:47:38,420
in the property observer, when the face view got set.
当face view调用set方法时，我们为它设置代理。

1077
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:40,789
We could do the same thing adding adjuster recognizer.
我们可以通过同样的方法来添加手势识别器。

1078
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,924
In fact, we're going to do that in the demo.
事实上，我们会在demo中演示这个过程。

1079
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:44,926
So here I have an IV outlet.
这里我有一个IBOutlet属性。

1080
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:47,361
It's just a UI view.
就是一个

1081
00:47:47,363 --> 00:47:49,363
In my story board.
storyboard中的视图。

1082
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:50,864
It's called pannableView and
它叫pannableView

1083
00:47:50,866 --> 00:47:54,000
I'm going to make it so it can pan around in there.
我希望可以拖动这个视图。

1084
00:47:54,002 --> 00:47:58,170
All right, and in his property observer there the did stat.
好的，在这个属性监听器的didSet方法中。

1085
00:47:59,206 --> 00:48:02,274
I'm going to add this gesture recognizer.
我将添加这个识别器。

1086
00:48:02,276 --> 00:48:04,242
I'm going to create a pan gesture recognizer and
我需要创建pan手势识别器，

1087
00:48:04,244 --> 00:48:05,376
then add it to the view.
然后添加到视图中。

1088
00:48:05,378 --> 00:48:06,577
So here I'm creating it.
这里我创建它。

1089
00:48:06,579 --> 00:48:08,813
This is just
我只需要

1090
00:48:08,814 --> 00:48:11,048
calling UIPanGestureRecognizer initializer here.
调用UIPanGestureRecognizer的初始化方法即可。

1091
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:13,750
The arguments to the initializer are who to
第一个参数表示，当手势被识别的时候，

1092
00:48:13,752 --> 00:48:18,421
send a message to when the gesture is recognized.
向谁发送消息。

1093
00:48:18,423 --> 00:48:20,122
When we start seeing a pan.
当视图识别到pan手势。

1094
00:48:20,124 --> 00:48:22,224
And as the pan is happening we're gonna be
我们会向这个对象

1095
00:48:22,226 --> 00:48:24,159
sending a message to this object.
发送一个消息。

1096
00:48:24,161 --> 00:48:25,560
In this case it's self.
这里，它是self。

1097
00:48:25,562 --> 00:48:28,496
So this method would obviously be in a controller, right?
所以这个方法肯定在一个控制器中，不是吗？

1098
00:48:28,498 --> 00:48:29,597
Because controllers are the only
因为只有

1099
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,031
things that have the outlets.
控制器才会有outlets。

1100
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,332
So this thing's going to be
所以这里

1101
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:34,367
handled by the controller itself.
会由控制器来处理。

1102
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:37,437
And then action is the name of the method.
action参数表示事件处理的方法名称。

1103
00:48:37,439 --> 00:48:38,971
It's just a string that is the name of
就是方法名称字符串，

1104
00:48:38,973 --> 00:48:41,874
the method that's gonna be
当手势被识别的时候，

1105
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:44,776
called in the controller when this gesture is recognized.
会调用控制器中的这个方法。

1106
00:48:44,778 --> 00:48:47,278
Now notice there's a little colon on the end there?
看见后面的冒号了吗？

1107
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,581
That means that it's called a, it's gonna
这表示

1108
00:48:50,583 --> 00:48:52,683
call a method called pan that has an argument.
这个pan方法会有一个参数。

1109
00:48:52,685 --> 00:48:54,251
That's what the colon means.
这就是冒号的意思。

1110
00:48:54,253 --> 00:48:55,786
There's an argument there.
表示方法需要一个参数。

1111
00:48:55,788 --> 00:48:58,221
Okay, now you don't have to have the colon there if
你也可以不添加冒号

1112
00:48:58,223 --> 00:49:00,690
you want, but if you don't have it there, then you
如果没有冒号，那么pan被调用的时候

1113
00:49:00,692 --> 00:49:02,958
won't get the argument when pan gets called and
你就得不到这个参数

1114
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,327
the argument you get is the gesture recognizer.
而这个参数就是GestureRecognizer

1115
00:49:05,329 --> 00:49:07,829
And for something like pan where you're gonna try and
有时候你需要

1116
00:49:07,831 --> 00:49:09,330
figure out where the finger is,
判断手指的点击位置，

1117
00:49:09,332 --> 00:49:10,965
you need the gesture recognizer so
这样你就必须得到这个参数

1118
00:49:10,967 --> 00:49:13,501
it can tell you where the finger is basically, okay?
来判断手指的触点在哪里。

1119
00:49:13,503 --> 00:49:15,235
So we almost always have a colon.
因此，我们通常都有冒号。

1120
00:49:15,237 --> 00:49:16,837
The only place you
只有在

1121
00:49:16,838 --> 00:49:18,438
wouldn't have a colon might be like a swipe.
使用swipe手势的时候你不需要冒号。

1122
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,507
Because the swipe just got recognized,
因为这就是一个swipe手势，

1123
00:49:20,509 --> 00:49:21,741
you don't really need any information,
你不需要额外的信息来判断，

1124
00:49:21,743 --> 00:49:25,762
you just need to know what happened.
你只需要确定这是一个swipe手势。

1125
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:29,782
So you might have action, quote, handle swipe, no colon.
所以你只需要在双引号中加上方法名称即可，不需要冒号。

1126
00:49:29,784 --> 00:49:31,016
Then we just ask the view,
然后，

1127
00:49:31,018 --> 00:49:33,785
this panable view, please recognize this gesture when it
当一个pan手势发生在视图边界的时候，

1128
00:49:33,787 --> 00:49:35,286
happens inside your bounds.
这个视图就可以识别这个手势了。

1129
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:40,257
Okay that's simple, that's like turning on,
就是这么简单，就像打开开关，

1130
00:49:40,259 --> 00:49:41,358
this is the on switch, for
比如switch控件，

1131
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,159
turning on that pan gesture I recognized,
可以通过pan手势

1132
00:49:43,161 --> 00:49:45,161
by asking some of you to recognize it.
来切换状态。

1133
00:49:45,163 --> 00:49:48,864
So now every time this view recognizes a pan going on
每次视图在边界内识别了pan手势的时候

1134
00:49:48,866 --> 00:49:51,933
inside its bounce it's going to send the message pan
它就会向控制器发送带一个参数的

1135
00:49:51,935 --> 00:49:54,268
with an argument to the controller.
pan消息。

1136
00:49:56,105 --> 00:49:56,970
Everybody okay with this?
都明白了吗？

1137
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:01,141
This is how you set up a gesture recognizer.
这是配置手势识别器的方法。

1138
00:50:01,143 --> 00:50:03,076
How about the handler?
那么如何处理事件呢？

1139
00:50:03,078 --> 00:50:06,379
So that pan thing with that argument, how do we do that?
有了这个参数后，我们可以做哪些事情呢？

1140
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:09,448
For us to handle the pan we need information about
在处理pan手势的时候，我们需要

1141
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:11,216
what's going on in that pan.
知道它的一些信息。

1142
00:50:11,218 --> 00:50:12,650
Where are the fingers moving?
比如手指移动到哪里了？

1143
00:50:12,652 --> 00:50:14,118
We need to know about that.
我们需要知道这些。

1144
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,788
So the concrete subclasses of UI gesture recognizer like UI
UIGestureRecognizer的子类，比如

1145
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:21,258
pangesture recognizer, they add methods that
PanGestureRecognizer，他们针对特定的手势

1146
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,727
are specific to whatever kind of gesture they are.
添加了自己特定的方法。

1147
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,930
So the panGesture one has a translation in
比如PanGesture就有translationInView方法，

1148
00:50:26,932 --> 00:50:30,900
view which tells you how far the finger has moved since,
用来告诉你 从手势被识别或重置开始

1149
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:34,737
either since the panGesture was first recognized, or
手指移动了多远的

1150
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:36,705
since that last got reset.
距离。

1151
00:50:38,141 --> 00:50:41,709
And you can reset with this set translation which will
你可以通过setTranslation方法

1152
00:50:41,711 --> 00:50:43,778
reset this translation to a different spot so
重置这个起点

1153
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,813
that the next time that you get notified,
这样下一次计算拖动距离的时候

1154
00:50:45,815 --> 00:50:47,948
it will be the distance between this.
会以你重置的起点开始计算。

1155
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:50,383
So that's a good way to get incremental panning instead of
这是一个得到增加距离的好方法

1156
00:50:50,385 --> 00:50:52,251
just the total distance that you've panned.
而不仅仅是得到总距离。

1157
00:50:52,253 --> 00:50:54,353
And then also I can tell you velocity,
还可以得到velocity（速度）

1158
00:50:54,355 --> 00:50:56,188
how fast are you panning around?
拖动的速度有多快？

1159
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,123
Is the person kinda moving real slow, or
用户可能拖动得很慢，或者是想

1160
00:50:58,125 --> 00:50:59,457
trying to put something in a perfect spot,
拖动到某个特定的点，

1161
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:01,559
or are they kind of zooming it around, okay,
又或者是在放大缩小等，

1162
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:03,327
you might react differently depending on the velocity.
你可能对不同的速度做出不同的反应。

1163
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:05,963
So those are the things that are very specific to Pan, so
这是pan手势的一些特有的东西，也是为什么

1164
00:51:05,965 --> 00:51:08,598
that's why these methods are in panGesture Recognizer.
这些方法属于PanGestureRecognizer。

1165
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,434
Now that last one is interesting because of
最后一个是incremental translation，

1166
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:12,669
this incremental translation.
这个很有趣。

1167
00:51:12,671 --> 00:51:15,071
A lot of people really don't quite understand this.
因为大多数人不是很理解这个。

1168
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:16,538
But you'll see when we do the demo, we'll
但是在做demo的时候你会明白的，

1169
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,341
do incremental translation with our pinch gesture.
我们会在pinch手势中演示incremental translation。

1170
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:22,711
And it'll make a little more sense what's going on there.
那时候你就更容易理解它了。

1171
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:24,912
The abstract superclass UIGestureRecognizer.
抽象类UIGestureRecognizer

1172
00:51:24,914 --> 00:51:27,581
It also has a very important property called State.
有个很重要的属性 叫state（状态）。

1173
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:31,685
Okay when you have a pan it actually goes through states.
pan手势会经历许多个状态。

1174
00:51:31,687 --> 00:51:34,421
It starts out in the state Possible.
首先是Possible状态。

1175
00:51:34,423 --> 00:51:36,656
It's possible a pan can happen.
表示它或许是一个pan手势。

1176
00:51:36,658 --> 00:51:38,290
Then if it were a swipe or
然后如果手势是扫动或者

1177
00:51:38,292 --> 00:51:40,959
a discrete gesture, you would just get one state.
非连续类型的，就会变为另一个状态。

1178
00:51:40,961 --> 00:51:42,160
Which is I recognize this.
就是Recognized状态。

1179
00:51:42,162 --> 00:51:44,629
So that's Recognized.
表示手势被识别了。

1180
00:51:44,631 --> 00:51:45,730
But if it's pan and
但是如果是pan手势

1181
00:51:45,732 --> 00:51:48,599
continuous, then you're gonna get began.
即手势连续的，state状态就会变为Began状态。

1182
00:51:48,601 --> 00:51:50,534
Okay, recognize that the pan has started.
明白吗，表示pan手势开始识别了。

1183
00:51:50,536 --> 00:51:51,602
You'll get that.
就是这样。

1184
00:51:51,603 --> 00:51:52,669
And then every time the finger moves,
随着手指的移动，

1185
00:51:52,671 --> 00:51:55,638
you're gonna get another call to your handler saying,
会不断通知事件处理对象

1186
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,106
changed, changed, changed.
状态改变为Changed了。

1187
00:51:57,108 --> 00:51:58,374
And then when the finger goes up,
当手指离开屏幕的时候，

1188
00:51:58,376 --> 00:52:01,443
you'll get another one that says the state is now ended.
状态就变为Ended。

1189
00:52:01,445 --> 00:52:03,245
So this is basically a little state machine.
这就像一个时间机器。

1190
00:52:03,247 --> 00:52:06,014
Obviously a pan goes through the state machine of possible,
pan手势在不同的时刻有不同的状态。

1191
00:52:06,016 --> 00:52:08,416
began, changed, ended.
开始，改变，结束。

1192
00:52:09,518 --> 00:52:10,951
All right?
明白吗？

1193
00:52:10,953 --> 00:52:12,085
There's also failed and
也有Failed和Canceled状态，

1194
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,720
canceled, like you're in the middle of a pan and
比如在pan手势的中途

1195
00:52:13,722 --> 00:52:15,721
a phone call comes in, okay?
一个电话打进来了，明白吗？

1196
00:52:15,723 --> 00:52:18,390
That's going to cancel that pan, alright?
这样这个pan手势就会被取消掉，知道吗？

1197
00:52:18,392 --> 00:52:20,859
So sometimes you have to pay attention to cancellation like
所以有时你需要注意手势的取消状态

1198
00:52:20,861 --> 00:52:23,395
that and sometimes not, it all depends on what you're doing
就像刚才这种情况，而有时候不必，

1199
00:52:23,397 --> 00:52:25,430
with your pan, sometimes your pan is updating.
这全由pan手势的当前状态决定，有时候，pan正在更新。

1200
00:52:25,432 --> 00:52:27,264
Whatever's there is in real time and
无论状态机当前处于什么状态

1201
00:52:27,266 --> 00:52:29,900
if the phone call comes in it just stops doing that and
如果有电话打入，状态机将暂停原有操作，

1202
00:52:29,902 --> 00:52:32,569
it's fine, everything is in perfectly fine state.
没问题，一切都处于正常的状态。

1203
00:52:32,571 --> 00:52:35,305
Other times it might be putting something in
有时候，pan手势会将一些东西

1204
00:52:35,307 --> 00:52:36,873
some temporary state and
放入在临时状态中

1205
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:40,643
now it's interrupted it's gotta clean up, or something.
当该手势被中断的时候，临时状态中得数据将被清空，或者做一些其他操作

1206
00:52:40,645 --> 00:52:42,111
All right. So given this information,
好，有了这些信息，

1207
00:52:42,113 --> 00:52:44,046
what would the pan handler look like?
那pan手势控制器到底是如何实现呢？

1208
00:52:44,048 --> 00:52:45,714
Okay? The pan
pan手势控制器

1209
00:52:45,715 --> 00:52:47,381
handler would be a method called pan.
是一个名叫 pan 的方法。

1210
00:52:47,384 --> 00:52:48,683
It would take one argument which is
该 方法带有一个参数

1211
00:52:48,685 --> 00:52:50,484
the UIPanGestureRecognizer itself.
即，UIPanGestureRecognizer本身。

1212
00:52:50,486 --> 00:52:52,453
You can see right there.
在这里你可以看到

1213
00:52:52,455 --> 00:52:53,721
Okay?

1214
00:52:53,722 --> 00:52:54,988
We're going to look at the state machine and
我们来看一下状态机，

1215
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:55,822
say what state it's in.
状态机处于什么样的状态。

1216
00:52:55,824 --> 00:52:58,108
So in my pan,
在pan手势中

1217
00:52:58,109 --> 00:53:00,393
I'm only going to do something when the gesture moves or
当手势移动或者手指上划，

1218
00:53:00,395 --> 00:53:01,727
the finger goes up.
我只需要稍微做一点点事

1219
00:53:01,729 --> 00:53:04,096
I'm not even gonna do anything when it first goes down.
当它第一次下划的时候，我不需要做任何事。

1220
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:05,364
I can choose which things I wanna do.
我可以选择，我想要的操作

1221
00:53:05,366 --> 00:53:08,099
But that's what I wanna do.
这些就是我想做的。

1222
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,600
Hopefully you know about fall through.
愿你们对fall through有所了解

1223
00:53:09,602 --> 00:53:10,801
You read that in the documentation.
你在文档中查阅过相关内容

1224
00:53:10,803 --> 00:53:13,070
Fall through is just a thing in switch that says
Fall through 是在 switch 中用于

1225
00:53:13,072 --> 00:53:15,772
the implementation of this case is to go to the next one.
说明当前case的函数实现，即为下一个case的函数实现

1226
00:53:15,774 --> 00:53:17,807
And do whatever the next one is, okay?
无论下一个case的实现是什么。

1227
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:19,175
So it just falls through to the next case.
所以，它就落到了下一个case.

1228
00:53:19,177 --> 00:53:20,660
So in changed and
在changed

1229
00:53:20,661 --> 00:53:22,144
ended, I'm gonna do exactly the same thing.
和ended中，我想执行相同的函数。

1230
00:53:22,146 --> 00:53:25,114
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna find out where
我要做的就是

1231
00:53:25,116 --> 00:53:30,585
the pan is in the coordinates of the panable view, so
在可拖动view的坐标系中，找出pan手势的位置

1232
00:53:30,587 --> 00:53:32,020
its coordinate system.
pan手势所在的坐标系

1233
00:53:32,022 --> 00:53:33,721
'Kay, that's translation in view.
好，那就是pan手势在view中的坐标

1234
00:53:33,723 --> 00:53:35,534
I give it the view.
我在view中得到这个坐标值

1235
00:53:35,535 --> 00:53:37,346
I want the coordinate system.
我需要坐标系

1236
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:39,158
It's gonna give me the point in that view where the pan is.
它将告诉我，在view中pan手势所在的点的位置

1237
00:53:39,161 --> 00:53:42,429
Then I'm gonna update anything I want inside of my controller
然后，我将更新控制器中我所需的东西

1238
00:53:42,431 --> 00:53:44,798
cuz this is being handled by the controller.
因为这就是由控制器来控制的

1239
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,567
So I'm gonna update anything I want based on that
所以，我要，基于x,y坐标轴，来更新任何我所需要的东西，

1240
00:53:47,569 --> 00:53:51,103
translation, x and y, then I'm gonna reset the translation
然后，再重置坐标，

1241
00:53:51,105 --> 00:53:54,340
and I don't have to do this but I'm going to in this case,
我并非每次都必须执行这一步，只是需要在这种情况下执行，

1242
00:53:54,342 --> 00:53:56,441
reset the translation back to 0, so
将坐标重置为0，

1243
00:53:56,443 --> 00:53:59,544
that the next time I get this called, in the next time it
所以，当下一次调用这个方法的时候，即下一次手势状态

1244
00:53:59,546 --> 00:54:02,980
changes it's gonna be just the difference.
改变的时候，将得到当前位置与上一次位置之间的偏差

1245
00:54:02,982 --> 00:54:05,616
Otherwise it's going to tell me from the time the gesture
在其他情况下，将得到第一次识别到手势

1246
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:07,351
was first recognized to where I am now.
到当前时间的时间差

1247
00:54:07,353 --> 00:54:08,719
So that'd be a big distance when I
当我移动的时候，我只想知道增加的距离

1248
00:54:08,721 --> 00:54:11,988
just want the incremental distance as I move around.
这有可能是一个很远的距离

1249
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:13,756
So that set translation to 0 is optional,
所以将坐标设置为0是可选的

1250
00:54:13,758 --> 00:54:14,490
you can do it if you want.
如果你想做的话，可以做。

1251
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,793
Okay? So that's it.
就这些

1252
00:54:17,795 --> 00:54:20,428
That's how we handle a gesture.
这是如何控制一个手势

1253
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:21,496
Very straight forward.
非常直白

1254
00:54:22,865 --> 00:54:23,931
So let's talk about some of
我们来讨论一下，当前存在的几个

1255
00:54:23,933 --> 00:54:26,133
the concrete gestures that exist.
具体的手势。

1256
00:54:26,135 --> 00:54:27,300
There's pinch.
有缩放(pinch)手势

1257
00:54:27,302 --> 00:54:28,434
Okay? Pinch,

1258
00:54:28,436 --> 00:54:29,735
instead of giving you translation,
pinch手势给你传递的不是坐标

1259
00:54:29,737 --> 00:54:31,103
it gives you scale.
而是比例

1260
00:54:31,105 --> 00:54:33,605
So when the pinch starts, the scale is 1.
当pinch手势开始的时候，比例为1

1261
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:35,840
If you spread your fingers out twice as wide,
如果你把你的手指拉宽两倍

1262
00:54:35,842 --> 00:54:37,108
the scale would be 2.
比例将变成2

1263
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:40,744
If you go down to half as wide, the scale would be 0.5.
如果你将手指靠拢到一半的位置，比例将变成0.5

1264
00:54:40,746 --> 00:54:42,379
Okay?

1265
00:54:42,381 --> 00:54:44,280
So that's how pinches work.
这就是pinch手势的工作原理

1266
00:54:44,282 --> 00:54:45,548
And it'll tell you the velocity.
它也会告诉你速度

1267
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:47,283
How fast the person is pinching.
用户缩放的速度有多快

1268
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:48,350
There's also rotation.
还有旋转(rotation)手势

1269
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:50,218
So that's a two finger thing as well.
这也是一个两个手指的手势

1270
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,020
You turn in a circle.
你转一个圈

1271
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,305
So it's like you're turning a knob.
就像在转动一个旋钮

1272
00:54:54,306 --> 00:54:56,589
It tells you how many radians the thing has been rotated.
它会告诉你，该物体旋转了多少弧度

1273
00:54:56,592 --> 00:54:58,158
Okay?

1274
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,826
And it'll also tell you how fast in
它也会告诉你，旋转的过程中

1275
00:54:59,828 --> 00:55:01,961
radians per second the rotations happen.
每秒转动的弧度

1276
00:55:01,963 --> 00:55:03,529
So that's the way you can rotate.
这就是你旋转的方式

1277
00:55:03,531 --> 00:55:04,997
There's also swipes.
接下来是滑动(swipes)手势

1278
00:55:04,999 --> 00:55:06,165
Now, swipes are a little different.
现在，swipes手势有一些不同

1279
00:55:06,167 --> 00:55:08,834
When you create the swipe gesture, okay,
当你创建一个swipes手势的时候，

1280
00:55:08,836 --> 00:55:11,670
back in the property observer of the outlet,
返回到outlet的property observer中

1281
00:55:11,672 --> 00:55:13,237
I created a pan gesture.
我创建了一个pan手势

1282
00:55:13,239 --> 00:55:15,239
But if I created a swipe gesture there,
但如果我创建了一个swipe手势

1283
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:16,440
I would send a message,
我将发送一条消息

1284
00:55:16,442 --> 00:55:18,475
set the property of the swipe gesture,
来设置swipe手势的属性，

1285
00:55:18,477 --> 00:55:21,544
number of touches required, or swipe direction there, and
点击所需的次数，或者滑动的方向

1286
00:55:21,546 --> 00:55:24,580
that determines whether it's a two finger swipe to the left
这也决定了是两个手指向左滑动，

1287
00:55:24,582 --> 00:55:27,016
or a one finger swipe down, or whatever.
还是一个手指向下滑动，或者其他什么。

1288
00:55:27,018 --> 00:55:29,351
You just kinda say what kind of swipe you're looking for,
你只需要说明你在查找的滑动类型

1289
00:55:29,353 --> 00:55:32,487
and then your handler would only be called once,
在状态为.Recognized的情况下，

1290
00:55:32,489 --> 00:55:35,924
with the state .Recognized when that combination
一旦手指合并，且向指定方向滑动，

1291
00:55:35,926 --> 00:55:37,625
of fingers and direction happens.
控制器将会被调用

1292
00:55:37,627 --> 00:55:40,661
So that's a little different than these other ones.
所以，这里与其他的有些不同

1293
00:55:40,663 --> 00:55:41,995
And there's also tap, a question.
接下来是点击(Tap)手势，有问题。

1294
00:55:41,997 --> 00:55:46,366
>> Also for these gestures I said you can now test in
>> 对于这些手势，我想说，你现在可以在

1295
00:55:46,368 --> 00:55:48,668
the simulator, right?
模拟器中测试，对嘛？

1296
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:50,036
>> Can you test these in the simulator?
>> 你可以在模拟器中，测试这些手势吗？

1297
00:55:50,038 --> 00:55:50,869
Absolutely you can test these in
你当然可以在模拟器中测试这些手势，

1298
00:55:50,871 --> 00:55:52,454
the simulator, I'll show you.
我将会展示给你们看。

1299
00:55:52,455 --> 00:55:54,038
>> How do you test more than one finger?
>> 你要如何测试多于一个手指的手势呢？

1300
00:55:54,041 --> 00:55:56,675
>> Yes, how do you test more than one finger in
>> 对，你要如何在模拟器中测试多于一个手指的手势

1301
00:55:56,677 --> 00:55:59,577
the simulator, I'll show you how to do that.
我将会给你们展示，这个手势的操作方法。

1302
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:01,078
Tap gesture is an interesting one.
点击（Tap）手势是比较有趣的手势之一。

1303
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,196
It seems like it would be
这个手势看起来似乎是

1304
00:56:02,197 --> 00:56:03,313
discrete because it's kind of like swipe.
间断的，因为这类似于滑动（swipe）手势。

1305
00:56:03,315 --> 00:56:05,582
You set up the number of taps and the number of touches.
你可以设置点击(tap)和触摸(touch)的次数

1306
00:56:05,584 --> 00:56:08,018
Except for that if you have a double tap it'll actually tell
除此之外，如果你双击，事实上它会告诉

1307
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,887
you about the first tap and the second tap.
你第一次的点击和第二次的点击。

1308
00:56:10,889 --> 00:56:12,988
So if you're only interested in the actual double tap you
所以，如果你需要知道双击

1309
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:14,323
can just look at the state ending because
你可以只关注结束的状态

1310
00:56:14,325 --> 00:56:15,957
that's the end of that gesture.
因为那是该手势的结尾

1311
00:56:15,959 --> 00:56:18,793
But if you want to look at the intermediate states you
但如果你想要关注中间状态

1312
00:56:18,795 --> 00:56:22,163
can actually look at the dot changed stated as well, so
实际上，你也可以查看点改变的状态

1313
00:56:22,165 --> 00:56:23,998
it's not purely a discrete gesture tap.
所以这并不是一个真正的分离手势

1314
00:56:25,701 --> 00:56:28,535
Okay, so let's go look at how we do gestures by putting some
好，一起来看一下，我们应该如何为

1315
00:56:28,537 --> 00:56:29,436
gestures in the FaceView.
FaceView添加手势

1316
00:56:29,438 --> 00:56:31,137
So I'm gonna put two gestures in.
我要添加两个手势

1317
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:35,141
I'm gonna put in pinch to change the size of the face,
添加pinch手势来改变脸的大小

1318
00:56:35,143 --> 00:56:40,612
and then I'm gonna put in pan to control the happiness,
然后，添加pan手势来控制表情

1319
00:56:40,614 --> 00:56:41,980
in other words, control my model.
换句话说，控制我的模型

1320
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,515
All right?

1321
00:56:44,517 --> 00:56:45,382
With pan.
用pan手势

1322
00:56:45,384 --> 00:56:46,900
When I move up and
当我上下拖动，

1323
00:56:46,901 --> 00:56:48,417
down it's gonna be happy is up, sad is down.
向上拖动时，是开心的表情；向下拖动时，是悲伤的表情。

1324
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:50,020
Not a swipe but actual pan so
不是滑动，而是拖动

1325
00:56:50,022 --> 00:56:52,855
I can move my happiness up in small increments if I want.
所以，如果我想的话，我也可以将这个表情向上移动一点

1326
00:56:54,191 --> 00:56:57,693
All right, so let's go back to here to do that.
好，让我们继续。

1327
00:56:57,695 --> 00:57:03,765
So let's go get some more space here.
让我们腾出更多的空间

1328
00:57:03,767 --> 00:57:06,100
So we'll go here.
从这里开始

1329
00:57:06,102 --> 00:57:10,170
So we'll do the pinch first.
我们先来完成这个pinch手势

1330
00:57:10,172 --> 00:57:12,105
Let's do the pinch first.
先做pinch手势

1331
00:57:12,107 --> 00:57:14,707
So the first thing I'm gonna do when I
当我添加pinch手势的时候，我要做的第一件事

1332
00:57:14,709 --> 00:57:18,444
make my pinch happen is to add a gesture recognizer.
添加一个手势识别器

1333
00:57:18,446 --> 00:57:22,181
A pinch gesture recognizer to my FaceView.
针对FaceView的pinch手势识别器

1334
00:57:22,183 --> 00:57:24,483
And so a great place to do that,
添加这个方法的位置

1335
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:26,784
as I said, is in the property observer of the FaceView.
正如我所说，就是在FaceView的Property Observer中

1336
00:57:26,787 --> 00:57:29,554
So here I can just say, add gesture.
所以，这里我只需要写addGesture

1337
00:57:29,556 --> 00:57:31,155
Whoops, sorry, FaceView.
抱歉，FaceView

1338
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:32,490
FaceView.

1339
00:57:32,492 --> 00:57:34,458
Add gesture recognizer.
AddGestureRecognizer.

1340
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,460
And this is just any kind of gesture recognizer.
这是任意类型的手势识别器

1341
00:57:36,462 --> 00:57:37,627
I'm going to do a pan Gesture.
而我要做的是pan手势

1342
00:57:37,629 --> 00:57:40,329
So I'm going to say UI Pan gesture recognizer.
所以，我要写 UIPanGestureRecognizer

1343
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,497
And then you can see that it
你可以看到

1344
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:44,199
has target in action are the arguments.
action中的target是参数

1345
00:57:44,201 --> 00:57:48,103
So the target I'm gonna have the pinch be handled

1346
00:57:48,105 --> 00:57:50,171
entirely by the view.

1347
00:57:50,173 --> 00:57:52,440
Because all it's doing is changing the view scale.
因为手势的所有操作，都是在改变view的比例

1348
00:57:52,442 --> 00:57:53,991
Its own scale.
view本身的比例

1349
00:57:53,992 --> 00:57:55,541
So there's no reason I'm the controller I don't need to
毫无疑问，controller没有必要

1350
00:57:55,544 --> 00:57:56,843
get involved with that.
涉及动作

1351
00:57:56,845 --> 00:58:00,347
So I'm just going to have the target be the FaceView.
所以，我只需要将FaceView传给target

1352
00:58:00,349 --> 00:58:04,183
So the FaceView is going to handle this pan.
由FaceView处理pan

1353
00:58:04,185 --> 00:58:06,085
Or, sorry, we're doing pan, no, we'll do pinch.
抱歉，我们正在写pan手势,我们本来要做pinch手势的

1354
00:58:06,087 --> 00:58:06,985
So I'm doing pinch.
我正在做pinch手势

1355
00:58:09,289 --> 00:58:10,522
Your pinch first.
先做pinch手势

1356
00:58:10,524 --> 00:58:11,940
So we're doing pinch.
正在做pinch手势

1357
00:58:11,941 --> 00:58:13,357
So we're doing the pinch of scale, not pan, sorry.
我们正在做比例的缩放，并不是pan，抱歉

1358
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,426
We're doing the pinch and I'm gonna have the FaceView
我们在做pinch手势，我将要用FaceView

1359
00:58:15,428 --> 00:58:18,128
handle this because it's just gonna modify its scale.
来控制pinch手势，因为它仅仅改变了FaceView的比例

1360
00:58:19,064 --> 00:58:25,201
And this action needs to be some nonprivate method
对于action，在FaceView中，需要一个非私有的方法

1361
00:58:25,203 --> 00:58:28,904
in my FaceView that I can call to handle it.
用来调用这个函数。

1362
00:58:28,906 --> 00:58:33,308
So, let's go ahead and go over to our faceview and
继续，到faceview

1363
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:34,509
add such a thing.
添加这样的一个东西

1364
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:38,412
So I'm going to call this method, what to call it?
我要调用这个方法，那么，谁来调用它？

1365
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:39,813
Scale.

1366
00:58:39,815 --> 00:58:42,299
Okay?

1367
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,784
And it's going to take a UI pinch gesture recognizer
它将把UIPinchGestureRecognizer

1368
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:47,687
as an argument, and we'll call that the gesture.
作为参数，我们将使用这个手势。

1369
00:58:48,956 --> 00:58:52,157
And all this is gonna do is modify our scale.
所有的这些，都是用来调整比例大小的

1370
00:58:53,894 --> 00:58:54,459
Okay?

1371
00:58:55,661 --> 00:58:56,960
Understand? You got this method here?
明白吗？都理解这个方法了吗？

1372
00:58:56,962 --> 00:58:58,562
So how is this method gonna do this?
那么，这个方法将要做些什么呢？

1373
00:58:58,564 --> 00:59:03,833
Well, I'm only going to adjust my scale when the pinch moves.
好，pinch的时候，我只是在调整比例

1374
00:59:04,769 --> 00:59:06,869
I'm not gonna do it when it first goes down because it's
当手指第一次点击到屏幕的时候，我无需执行这个方法

1375
00:59:06,871 --> 00:59:09,037
gonna be scale of 1 anyway, and
因为此时无论如何它的比例都将是1

1376
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:11,873
I probably should do it when the fingers go up, but just to
当手指移开的时候，我应该要执行这个方法，但是

1377
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:14,842
make less code here I'm just gonna do it when it changes.
这里尽可能少写一点代码，因为我只想在手势改变的时候执行

1378
00:59:14,844 --> 00:59:23,450
So I'm gonna say if the gesture state equals .changed.
所以，我会写如果手势的状态等于 .changed

1379
00:59:23,452 --> 00:59:24,751
Okay.

1380
00:59:24,753 --> 00:59:28,955
Then I'm going to take my own scale and
然后，我将用原来的比例(scale)

1381
00:59:28,957 --> 00:59:32,891
multiply it by the gestures scale.
乘以手势的比例(gesture.scale)

1382
00:59:32,893 --> 00:59:33,992
Okay.

1383
00:59:33,994 --> 00:59:35,994
So if the gesture pinch scales out.
如果手势向外拉伸

1384
00:59:35,996 --> 00:59:37,261
I'm going to make my scale bigger.
将使得比例增大

1385
00:59:37,263 --> 00:59:39,630
If it scales in I'm going to make my scale smaller.
如果手势向内靠拢，将使得比例缩小

1386
00:59:39,632 --> 00:59:41,716
Okay.

1387
00:59:41,717 --> 00:59:43,801
And I'm going to reset the gesture scale back to 1
我要把手势的比例(gesture.scale)重置为1

1388
00:59:43,803 --> 00:59:45,403
all the time.
任何情况下

1389
00:59:45,404 --> 00:59:47,004
By resetting it back to 1 then I'm only getting the
通过将比例重置为1，我才能只获取到

1390
00:59:47,006 --> 00:59:49,439
difference between the last time it told me to update.
用于更新的最后一次变化的比例大小

1391
00:59:49,441 --> 00:59:52,975
So that way I can update my scale every time it moves.
每当手势移动的时候，我将会更新比例

1392
00:59:52,977 --> 00:59:54,643
And since I keep resetting back to one,
再将比例重置为1

1393
00:59:54,645 --> 00:59:56,178
I keep getting incremental scale.
我一直获取增加的比例

1394
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,979
It's gonna keep making my scale bigger or
根据最后一次

1395
00:59:57,981 --> 01:00:00,148
smaller depending on whether the last movement of
缩放的情况

1396
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:02,283
the pinch was bigger or smaller.
使得比例变大或者变小

1397
01:00:02,285 --> 01:00:04,552
This makes my code a lot simpler.
这使得代码简洁很多

1398
01:00:04,554 --> 01:00:06,887
So that's it. That's all that's necessary.
就是这些，这就是所有必需的代码

1399
01:00:07,923 --> 01:00:11,257
And it's typical for gesture recognizers to be this simple,
一个典型的手势识别器的代码就是如此简单

1400
01:00:11,259 --> 01:00:14,827
to not require a lot of code.
不需要编写一大堆的代码

1401
01:00:14,829 --> 01:00:16,862
So, this is the name of the handler.
所以 scale 是 handler 的名称

1402
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:18,731
So, let's go back to our controller and
让我们回到控制器的代码

1403
01:00:18,733 --> 01:00:20,932
put that in here, the action is scale.
把手势识别器的 action 设置为 scale

1404
01:00:20,934 --> 01:00:22,500
And it did take that argument.
由于这是其中的一个参数

1405
01:00:22,502 --> 01:00:23,835
So, I do need to put the colon there.
所以我需要在 scale 后面加上一个冒号

1406
01:00:23,837 --> 01:00:25,970
Okay, and that's it.
完成了

1407
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,071
That's all that's required.
所有所需的代码我们都完成了

1408
01:00:28,073 --> 01:00:28,972
So, let's go ahead and try it.
让我们运行一下来看看

1409
01:00:30,075 --> 01:00:33,942
Now as was being asked here, how do I do two fingers,
这里我经常被问到的一个问题就是，如何我模拟两个手指的操作

1410
01:00:33,944 --> 01:00:35,477
I only got one mouse here.
我只有一个鼠标

1411
01:00:35,479 --> 01:00:38,279
And the answer is you hold down the option key.
回答是，你按住 option 键

1412
01:00:38,281 --> 01:00:41,582
You see when you hold down option, you get two fingers.
当你按住 option 键时，你模拟了两个手指的操作

1413
01:00:41,584 --> 01:00:46,353
Okay, and they're evenly spaced from the middle, and
没有问题吧？这两个手指与中心相对称

1414
01:00:46,355 --> 01:00:49,255
I can use them to pinch in and out.
我能使用这两个手指来模拟缩放的操作

1415
01:00:52,193 --> 01:00:55,311
Okay, there we go.
让我们继续

1416
01:00:55,312 --> 01:00:58,430
So you can see adding gestures really, really simple, okay.
你可以通过上面的演示看到，添加一个手势识别器是非常简单的

1417
01:00:58,432 --> 01:00:59,698
You can do other things too.
当然你也可以做其他的事情

1418
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:04,702
If I can remember here I think Cmd, what is it.
可能是 ⌘ 键吧，我记得

1419
01:01:04,704 --> 01:01:06,287
There's other things too,
用鼠标模拟其他的手指操作

1420
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:07,871
I can't remember offhand what they are but
我现在记不起来了，但是

1421
01:01:07,874 --> 01:01:11,408
you can take the two things and move them.
你可以模拟两指移动

1422
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:12,843
There we go. I'm using Shift.
噢，就是这个，按住 Control 键的同时，按住 Shift 键

1423
01:01:12,845 --> 01:01:14,444
Now you can move them up here.
现在你可以用鼠标模拟两个手指同时上移

1424
01:01:14,446 --> 01:01:18,814
So that you can expand them out from here or whatever.
你可以模拟把这个图形扩展开或者其他的什么操作

1425
01:01:18,816 --> 01:01:20,282
So you can control them a little bit.
但是你只能用鼠标模拟一点点的手指动作

1426
01:01:20,284 --> 01:01:22,384
Only two, you can't do three fingers or whatever.
因为你只能模拟两个手指的动作，不能模拟两个手指以上的动作

1427
01:01:22,386 --> 01:01:25,020
So there's some limitations but
尽管有些局限性

1428
01:01:25,022 --> 01:01:28,089
you can do some stuff there, all right.
但是至少你能在模拟器里模拟一些手指动作，明白了吗？

1429
01:01:28,091 --> 01:01:29,274
So that's good. So
很好

1430
01:01:29,275 --> 01:01:30,458
now let's talk about another gesture.
让我们继续讲一下其他的手势

1431
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,826
Let's do a pan gesture, where
让我们来做一个拖动手势识别器（Pan Gesture）

1432
01:01:36,165 --> 01:01:41,000
if I pan up it's gonna make my guy happier and
当我向上拖动的时候，我希望让我们的小人看上去比较开心

1433
01:01:41,002 --> 01:01:42,535
if I pan down it's gonna make him sadder.
当我向下拖动的时候，我希望让我们的小人看上去比较难过

1434
01:01:43,637 --> 01:01:44,736
Okay.
没问题吧？

1435
01:01:44,737 --> 01:01:45,836
So I can use a pan gesture for that.
我可以使用一个拖动手势识别器来实现

1436
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:48,139
Now, I could just go right here and
我在这个 faceView 里添加与之前 Pinch Gesture 类似的代码

1437
01:01:48,141 --> 01:01:54,445
do the same thing, I could say faceView.addGestureRecognizer-
这里我输入 faceView.addGestureRecognizer

1438
01:01:54,447 --> 01:01:59,316
(UIPanGestureRecognizer{target .
UIPanGestureRecognizer(target: ...

1439
01:01:59,318 --> 01:02:00,884
The target would be myself.
target 将会是 self

1440
01:02:00,886 --> 01:02:05,154
Because if I'm modifying the model with that pan gesture,
因为我通过这个拖动手势识别器改变了我的 Model

1441
01:02:05,156 --> 01:02:06,555
my view can't do that.
我的 View 不能够完成这些

1442
01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:08,590
The controller has to handle it itself.
必须由控制器来处理

1443
01:02:08,592 --> 01:02:10,125
And we can have the action of
然后我们可以把这样的一个 Action

1444
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:12,960
this thing be something like changeHappiness.
称之为 changeHappiness

1445
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:14,362
Take that argument or something.
接受一个参数或者是其他什么的东西

1446
01:02:14,364 --> 01:02:15,813
So I could do this.
我可以按照之前我所说的这么做

1447
01:02:15,814 --> 01:02:17,263
But I'm not gonna do it this way, okay.
但我不想这么做，好吗？

1448
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:18,231
This would be perfectly fine.
我这么写，一点问题都没有

1449
01:02:18,233 --> 01:02:19,332
But I'm gonna show you how
但是我想演示给你们

1450
01:02:19,334 --> 01:02:22,235
you can set up gestures in the storyboard.
如何在 Storyboard 中添加手势识别器

1451
01:02:22,237 --> 01:02:25,071
So you don't even need this line of code, okay.
所以你甚至都不需要这段代码

1452
01:02:25,073 --> 01:02:26,972
So here's how that works.
接下来看好

1453
01:02:26,974 --> 01:02:27,773
We're gonna go over here.
我们点击这里

1454
01:02:27,775 --> 01:02:29,207
Let's get our storyboard.
点击我们的 Main.storyboard

1455
01:02:30,944 --> 01:02:35,779
And I wanna add a gesture recognizer to this view.
我想在这个视图之上添加一个手势识别器

1456
01:02:35,781 --> 01:02:37,748
I do it by going over here,
我先点击这里

1457
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:41,117
same place where I add things to my view here.
在我向我的视图添加控件的这个地方

1458
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,519
If you go down towards the bottom,
如果你向下滚动

1459
01:02:43,521 --> 01:02:46,722
you'll see that there's tap gesture, pinch gesture,
你会看到里面有单击（Tap）、缩放（Pinch）

1460
01:02:46,724 --> 01:02:49,525
rotation gesture, swipe gesture, pan gesture.
旋转（Rotation）、滑动（Swipe）、拖动（Pan）的手势识别器

1461
01:02:49,527 --> 01:02:50,092
Okay.

1462
01:02:50,094 --> 01:02:54,763
So I'm gonna grab this pan gesture and drop it on this
我这里拖动这个拖动手势识别器并将其放在

1463
01:02:54,765 --> 01:02:59,266
view, which says I want this view to recognize a pan.
这个视图之上，这也就表示我希望这个视图识别一个拖动手势

1464
01:02:59,268 --> 01:03:01,268
Now you might say, whoa, where'd that go?
现在你可能会问，这个识别器去哪里了？

1465
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:03,503
I didn't see anything there what's going on?
我没发现任何东西有变化

1466
01:03:03,505 --> 01:03:05,572
Where is that thing, it's hard to tell.
我怎么才能找到这个识别器呢？

1467
01:03:05,574 --> 01:03:06,839
Well, there's two places you
好的，有两个地方你可以

1468
01:03:06,841 --> 01:03:08,474
can find that thing you just dropped.
找到你刚才放置的手势识别器

1469
01:03:08,476 --> 01:03:10,009
One is in the document outline.
一个是在 Document Outline 中

1470
01:03:10,011 --> 01:03:11,443
You see it right here?
你在这里看到了吗？

1471
01:03:11,445 --> 01:03:13,345
Pan Gesture Recognizer.
Pan Gesture Recognizer

1472
01:03:13,347 --> 01:03:15,380
Another one is, right at the top.
另外一个地方是，就在这个视图的顶部

1473
01:03:15,382 --> 01:03:17,348
If you look at the view controller right here, you'll
如果你在 Storyboard 中查看你的 View Controller，你会

1474
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:19,550
see there's a Pan Gesture Recognizer right there.
看到这里有一个叫 Pan Gesture Recognizer 的东西

1475
01:03:20,853 --> 01:03:22,852
Okay. Now all you need to do
好的，现在你所要做的就是

1476
01:03:22,854 --> 01:03:26,422
to make this pan gesture recognizer be handled by your
让这个拖动手势识别器被你的控制器所处理

1477
01:03:26,424 --> 01:03:28,257
controller is Ctrl + drag.
利用 Control 键加拖动

1478
01:03:28,259 --> 01:03:32,994
So I'm holding down Ctrl and dragging in here, okay.
我这里按住我的 Control 键，并拖动到这里

1479
01:03:32,996 --> 01:03:34,930
Let go.
释放拖动

1480
01:03:34,931 --> 01:03:36,865
It's an action kind of like target action for
这是一个 Action，类似于按钮中的 Target Action

1481
01:03:36,867 --> 01:03:38,800
a button, but not quite exactly the same.
但不是完全相同

1482
01:03:38,802 --> 01:03:42,803
And I'm gonna call this change happiness cuz that's what
我把这个 Action 称之为 changeHappiness 因为

1483
01:03:42,805 --> 01:03:44,137
this pan gesture does.
这是这个拖动手势识别器所做的事情

1484
01:03:44,139 --> 01:03:46,339
Again, type I don't want to be any object.
再一次注意，这里的类型我不希望是 AnyObject

1485
01:03:46,341 --> 01:03:47,640
This is gonna be the type of the argument.
这里设置的是参数的类型

1486
01:03:47,642 --> 01:03:49,775
I want it to be Pan Gesture Recognizer.
我想要让我参数的类型是 UIPanGestureRecognizer

1487
01:03:49,777 --> 01:03:51,477
If you leave any object in there you'll have to be
如果你这里保留的是 AnyObject，那么

1488
01:03:51,479 --> 01:03:55,247
using as to turn it into a pan gesture recognizer so we can
你将要使用 as 将其类型转换为一个 UIPanGestureRecognizer 再使用它

1489
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:57,916
use it, but obviously a lot easier to just click it here.
显然我这里设置好比较简单

1490
01:03:57,918 --> 01:04:00,785
The same as we had when we did button action.
这和我们处理按钮的时候是一样的

1491
01:04:00,787 --> 01:04:03,988
So it can connect, okay, here it is right here.
单击 Connect，好的，一个 Action 方法就建立好了

1492
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:06,656
Let's go look at it.
让我们看看

1493
01:04:07,626 --> 01:04:09,625
Okay, change happiness.
changeHappiness

1494
01:04:09,627 --> 01:04:11,360
And now we just need to implement this one.
现在我们只需要实现这个方法即可

1495
01:04:11,362 --> 01:04:15,464
So, what do we need to do to change our happiness?
我们需要在 changeHappiness 中做什么呢？

1496
01:04:15,466 --> 01:04:17,832
Well the pan is moving up and down,
我们知道，这个拖动手势识别的是拖上拖下的操作

1497
01:04:17,834 --> 01:04:20,668
so I can get the coordinates of the pan in the face views
我可以获取到，在 faceView 中拖动时手指的坐标位置

1498
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:22,587
coordinate system, but
在 faceView 的坐标系中

1499
01:04:22,588 --> 01:04:24,505
I really need to turn that into a happiness change in
但是，我真正需要的是将坐标的变换

1500
01:04:24,507 --> 01:04:27,341
some interpretations.
解释成一些其他的东西，其他可以导致我的小人脸部表情变化的东西

1501
01:04:27,343 --> 01:04:29,676
So again the controller is now interpreting what's
再一次，控制器现在承担了解释的操作

1502
01:04:29,678 --> 01:04:32,212
happening in the view for the model, so it's going in
为 Model 解释 View 目前正在发生什么

1503
01:04:32,214 --> 01:04:34,280
the opposite direction of where we went before.
是不是与之前的方向相反

1504
01:04:34,282 --> 01:04:36,615
And again, that's the controller's main job,
再次重申，这个才是控制器的主要任务

1505
01:04:36,617 --> 01:04:38,650
interpreting the model for the view and
为 View 去解释 Model，同时

1506
01:04:38,652 --> 01:04:41,286
the view input to modify the model.
接受 View 的输入来改变 Model

1507
01:04:41,288 --> 01:04:42,654
So how's this going to work?
这里怎么让我们的方法工作？

1508
01:04:42,656 --> 01:04:48,159
So again, I'm going to do sender.state = .changed.
我输入 if sender.state == .changed

1509
01:04:48,161 --> 01:04:50,561
I'm not going to do this because if I do this,
噢，我不打算这么做，因为如果我这么做的话

1510
01:04:50,563 --> 01:04:52,229
everyone out there is going to start doing the same thing.
你们每一个人也将会做同样的事情

1511
01:04:52,231 --> 01:04:54,898
So let's do a switch of this.
让我们使用一个 switch

1512
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:58,067
I'm going to switch on the gestures, state.
输入 switch gesture.state

1513
01:04:58,069 --> 01:05:02,004
I'm going to handle the case where it ended and
在里面，我会处理 .Ended 这样的情况

1514
01:05:02,006 --> 01:05:06,675
I'm going to handle the case where it changed, okay.
同样我会处理 .Changed 这样的情况

1515
01:05:06,677 --> 01:05:08,443
And I'm just going to do them the same, so
这两个情况之下，我将使用同样的处理方法

1516
01:05:08,445 --> 01:05:11,179
I'll do this fall through like we did in the slides.
所以我将 .Ended 情况设置为 fallthrough，就在我们之前所做的那样

1517
01:05:11,181 --> 01:05:16,150
So, when this pan is changing or when the finger lifts up,
所以，当用户正在拖动，或者当他们的手指离开屏幕的时候

1518
01:05:16,152 --> 01:05:19,052
I'm going to try and change my happiness, okay.
我将尝试改变我的小人的 happiness，明白了吗？

1519
01:05:20,722 --> 01:05:24,123
So, first let's get the translation of the pan in
首先我们先在 faceView 的坐标系空间里

1520
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:26,392
the face views coordinate system.
将这个 translation

1521
01:05:26,394 --> 01:05:28,960
And to do that I'm going to send a message to the sender,
这里我要做的就是，给 Sender 发送一个消息

1522
01:05:28,962 --> 01:05:30,795
you see sender right here?
你看到这里的 Sender 了吗？

1523
01:05:30,797 --> 01:05:32,997
That's the pan gesture recognizer that
这就是我们在这里

1524
01:05:32,999 --> 01:05:34,465
is being handled here.
处理的 UIPanGestureRecognizer

1525
01:05:34,467 --> 01:05:36,567
We call this gesture in the other one and
我们称之为 sender

1526
01:05:36,569 --> 01:05:39,302
a lot of people like to change this to gesture,
另外有些人习惯称之为 gesture

1527
01:05:39,304 --> 01:05:42,172
which I think is perfectly fine to want to do.
这里我认为没有任何问题

1528
01:05:42,174 --> 01:05:43,873
So I'm going to ask the gesture,
接下来，我将要让 gesture

1529
01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:47,476
tell me the translation in the face views coordinate system.
告诉我在 faceView 坐标系中的转换结果

1530
01:05:47,478 --> 01:05:48,944
So now I know how much it's moved in
那么现在我就知道拖动操作在

1531
01:05:48,946 --> 01:05:50,812
the face view coordinate system.
faceView 的坐标系系统中到底移动了多少位置

1532
01:05:50,814 --> 01:05:53,448
And so I'm going to let the happiness change, this is
接下来，我要让 happinessChange

1533
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:56,217
the amount of change that's happening in my happiness.
变成我希望在 happiness 中变化的量

1534
01:05:56,219 --> 01:06:00,888
I could just have it be equal to translation.y, probably
我可以这里让它等于 translation.y

1535
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:04,291
would wanna be -translation.y because up means happy and
但是我更希望让它等于 -translation.y，因为向上拖动表示开心

1536
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,310
down means not happy.
向下拖动表示不开心

1537
01:06:06,311 --> 01:06:08,328
But that's going to change the happiness a lot with very
但是这里的问题时，一个很小的拖动就会极大地改变

1538
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:09,228
small movements.
happiness 的值

1539
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:11,230
So I don't really want that.
我不希望是这样的

1540
01:06:11,232 --> 01:06:15,934
So I really want to have, also it needs to be an int by
我真正希望的是，当然我希望它是一个整形的值

1541
01:06:15,936 --> 01:06:21,272
the way, so do that, because happiness is an int.
因为 happiness 本身是一个整形的值

1542
01:06:21,274 --> 01:06:22,907
I really want this changed last so
我真正希望的是，它的变化量不那么大

1543
01:06:22,909 --> 01:06:25,542
I'm going to actually divide this by a constant.
所以我会将 -translation.y 除以一个常量

1544
01:06:25,544 --> 01:06:27,344
So I'm going to create a constant here,
这里我将创建一个常量

1545
01:06:27,346 --> 01:06:31,514
Constants.HappinessGestureS- cale I'll call it.
称之为 Constants.HappinessGestureScale

1546
01:06:31,516 --> 01:06:34,917
And we'll go back up here and I'll do the private struct
我们回到上面，定义一个叫 Constants 的 private struct

1547
01:06:34,919 --> 01:06:39,888
constants, and this is a static let,
里面输入 static let

1548
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:45,594
this thing which is a CG float.
这个常量应该是一个 CGFloat

1549
01:06:48,965 --> 01:06:50,231
Let's do four.
让我们设置为4

1550
01:06:50,233 --> 01:06:52,199
So for every four points we move,
那么，我们每拖动或移动4个像素点

1551
01:06:52,201 --> 01:06:54,001
we'll move our happiness by one.
我们会让我们 happiness 改变1

1552
01:06:54,003 --> 01:06:55,586
Then we could play with this constant.
我们可以尝试不同的值

1553
01:06:55,587 --> 01:06:57,170
That's part of the reason I'm putting it out in a constant.
这就是为什么我把它单独拿出来的一个原因

1554
01:06:57,172 --> 01:06:59,639
We could play with this number until we got the feel that we
我们可以不断尝试其他的值，直到

1555
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:03,576
thought felt right for changing our happiness, okay.
我们觉得合适了

1556
01:07:03,578 --> 01:07:04,610
So we got our happiness changed.
现在，我们有了 happinessChange

1557
01:07:04,612 --> 01:07:08,280
So if the happiness change is not zero.
然后，如果 happinessChange 不是0的话

1558
01:07:08,282 --> 01:07:11,416
So if the happiness actually changed then I'm going to
那么我将改变我的 happiness

1559
01:07:11,418 --> 01:07:17,822
change my happiness, happiness += happinessChange.
happiness += happinessChange

1560
01:07:17,824 --> 01:07:19,490
I'm also going to do that reset thing.
接着我将做一些重置工作

1561
01:07:19,492 --> 01:07:23,927
So gesture.setTranslation(CGPoin-
gesture.setTranslation(CGPointZero,

1562
01:07:23,929 --> 01:07:26,629
tZero in my faceView.
inView: faceView)

1563
01:07:28,766 --> 01:07:32,167
I'm resetting it because I'm changing my happiness every
我重置它的原因是，当我每一次改变我的 happiness 的时候

1564
01:07:32,169 --> 01:07:34,836
time it changes, so I'm going to constantly be resetting it
我将持续重置它

1565
01:07:34,838 --> 01:07:37,338
so that it's incremental, okay.
以保证它是增量变化

1566
01:07:38,474 --> 01:07:41,775
And then of course we need to have the default case,
当然，我们需要 default 情况

1567
01:07:41,777 --> 01:07:44,478
which is going to be cancelled or failed or
比如说取消或者失败

1568
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,880
began, and I'm just going to do nothing in that case.
或者是刚开始的情况，那么我将在 default 情况下不做任何操作

1569
01:07:47,949 --> 01:07:50,949
So any other state that gets thrown to me, I'll do nothing.
那么另外的状态触发了 changeHappiness 后，我将不做任何操作

1570
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:53,952
So let's see if that works, let's run.
让我们看看是不是能够正常工作，让我们运行

1571
01:07:53,954 --> 01:07:59,457
Here we go, so now up is happier.
向上拖动，我们的小人看上去更开心了

1572
01:07:59,459 --> 01:08:00,758
Down is sad.
向下拖动，我们的小人看上去比较伤心

1573
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,292
Up, good.
再向上，很好

1574
01:08:02,294 --> 01:08:05,762
And we can still do this.
当然我们还可以做缩放的操作

1575
01:08:07,498 --> 01:08:12,901
Okay, so these gestures, they don't look the same.
好的，所以这些手势，它们是不一样的

1576
01:08:12,903 --> 01:08:14,302
Okay, they don't start the same.
从根本上就不一样

1577
01:08:14,304 --> 01:08:16,021
This one's a two-finger one,
这一个是双指手势

1578
01:08:16,022 --> 01:08:17,739
okay, and this is a one-finger one.
这一个是单指手势

1579
01:08:17,741 --> 01:08:19,640
So the system can easily tell the difference between
系统可以轻易分辨出

1580
01:08:19,642 --> 01:08:21,775
which one is going on and IOS is very good at
到底是哪一种手势

1581
01:08:21,777 --> 01:08:24,678
telling the difference between different gestures starting.
iOS 尤其擅长这部分的东西

1582
01:08:26,281 --> 01:08:28,614
Okay? So everybody got that?
每个人都弄明白了吗？

1583
01:08:28,616 --> 01:08:29,982
So we did a lot of different kind of
我们在这里处理了不同种类的

1584
01:08:29,984 --> 01:08:30,916
gesture handling there.
手势

1585
01:08:30,918 --> 01:08:32,283
We added one in a storyboard.
我们学习了如何通过 Storyboard 添加一个手势

1586
01:08:32,285 --> 01:08:33,251
We added one in code.
也学习了如何通过代码来添加

1587
01:08:33,253 --> 01:08:34,485
We handled one in our controller.
我们在我们的控制器中处理了一个

1588
01:08:34,487 --> 01:08:36,320
We handled one in our face view.
另外一个在 faceView 里处理了

1589
01:08:36,322 --> 01:08:39,256
One is scaling and pinching, the other one was translation.
前者的的操作是处理尺寸缩放，后者是处理坐标系的变换

1590
01:08:39,258 --> 01:08:41,175
So hopefully between those two,
所以我希望你们通过这两个

1591
01:08:41,176 --> 01:08:43,093
you can look through that code and kinda get a good feel for
的代码，知道手势识别大致的一个处理流程

1592
01:08:43,095 --> 01:08:44,060
how the gestures go.

1593
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:48,797
Okay, good, so we do have some time left.
好的，我们还剩下一些时间

1594
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:51,600
I'm going to get started on the next topic here.
我将开始讲下一个话题

1595
01:08:52,669 --> 01:08:56,004
Before I do that, because I'm going to get interrupted in
在这之前，我想打断一下

1596
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:59,206
the middle, let's talk quickly about what's coming up.
我要讲一下接下来的打算

1597
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:02,443
So on Wednesday I'm going to continue the slides that I'm
周三我们会继续 Slide

1598
01:09:02,445 --> 01:09:04,111
going to start in a minute here.
我马上要讲的这个 Slide

1599
01:09:04,113 --> 01:09:05,612
About multiple MVCs and
这个 Slide 有关多个 MVC

1600
01:09:05,614 --> 01:09:08,915
then I'm gonna do a big demo creating multiple MVCs in
我将要演示一个大的 demo，

1601
01:09:08,917 --> 01:09:11,717
our happiness controller, okay.
在 happiness controller 中创建多个 MVC

1602
01:09:11,719 --> 01:09:13,719
And again, time permitting, at the end of Wednesday I'll do
如果时间允许，在周三课程最后我会讲

1603
01:09:13,721 --> 01:09:16,788
another topic view controller lifecycle.
另一个主题，即 view controller 生命周期

1604
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:20,558
Friday, hopefully, it will have this instruments thing.
在周五，希望可以能够给大家讲一讲 instruments

1605
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,860
And then next Monday I put auto layout question mark.
在下周一… 我在 auto layout 后放了一个问号

1606
01:09:22,862 --> 01:09:24,128
Because I was telling you I was going to
因为我曾经告诉你们我会很快讲 auto layout 的内容

1607
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:25,796
do auto layout sooner but I keep putting it off.
但是总是推迟。

1608
01:09:25,798 --> 01:09:27,597
And I might put it off again, we'll see.
或许我会继续推迟，到时候就知道了。

1609
01:09:27,599 --> 01:09:29,182
But I won't be asking you in
但是我不会要求你们

1610
01:09:29,183 --> 01:09:30,766
your homework to do much sophisticated auto layout.
在课后花太多时间熟悉 auto layout 的内容。

1611
01:09:30,769 --> 01:09:32,568
So even it assignment three, there's very little.
所以尽管在它（auto layout）是第三次作业，但是也只是很少一部分内容。

1612
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:37,573
Okay, so next topic, multiple MVCs.
好的，下一个主题，多重 MVC。

1613
01:09:37,575 --> 01:09:39,574
So you remember this picture, I hope.
我希望你还记得这张图

1614
01:09:42,713 --> 01:09:45,847
Which was at the of the MVC talk where I talked about how
在讲到 MVC 的最后，我讲了如果我们想

1615
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:47,214
if we wanna build a big app,
构建一个大的应用，

1616
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:51,084
we're gonna do it by putting multiple MVCs together, okay.
我们将要把多个 MVC 放在一起来实现它。

1617
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:52,719
So we're gonna zoom in here and
将这幅图缩小

1618
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:55,254
take a look at exactly how that's done.
看一看到底是怎么实现的。

1619
01:09:55,256 --> 01:09:57,340
Okay, how we're
我们怎么

1620
01:09:57,341 --> 01:09:59,425
gonna make multiple combine multiple MVC's.
将多个 MVC 联系到一起。

1621
01:09:59,427 --> 01:10:00,977
Okay.

1622
01:10:00,978 --> 01:10:02,528
So you see that MVC right there the purple one
看最上边紫色的这个 MVC

1623
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:05,030
at the top, that's an MVC and you can
这是一个 MVC ，而且它（MVC）的 view

1624
01:10:05,032 --> 01:10:08,499
see that this view is actually made up of other MVC's.
实际上是由其它 MVC 组成的。

1625
01:10:10,003 --> 01:10:13,237
So iOS provides some controllers for
iOS 为 为一些 MVCs 中的 controllers 提供

1626
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:17,474
MVCs that have other MVCs as their view.
了其它 MVCs 作为 controllers 的 view。

1627
01:10:17,476 --> 01:10:19,375
And the three we're gonna talk about today,
今天我们要讲到三个 controller,

1628
01:10:19,377 --> 01:10:20,776
by the way you can build your own.
BTW, 你可以创建自己的 controller。

1629
01:10:20,778 --> 01:10:22,645
I'm not gonna talk about that today.
今天我不会讲怎么自定义 controller

1630
01:10:22,646 --> 01:10:24,513
You can build your own controllers that have MVCs as
你可以自定义 controller ，并将 其它 MVC 作为 view

1631
01:10:24,515 --> 01:10:26,615
the view, but I'm gonna talk about the three that are
但是我今天要讲的三种 controller 是 iOS 内置的

1632
01:10:26,617 --> 01:10:29,884
provided in iOS which you're gonna be using in this class.
也是你们在这节课将要用到的。

1633
01:10:29,886 --> 01:10:32,153
Which is TabBarController SplitViewControllers and
这三个 controller 分别是 TabBarController SplitViewControllers

1634
01:10:32,155 --> 01:10:34,689
NavigationControllers, 'kay.
和 NavigationControllers。

1635
01:10:34,691 --> 01:10:35,856
So these are just controllers,
它们都是controller

1636
01:10:35,858 --> 01:10:39,893
they're subclasses of UIViewController.
是 UIViewcontroller 的子类。

1637
01:10:39,895 --> 01:10:42,261
And they draw a little bit in their view but
而且它们会在它们的 view 中绘制一些东西

1638
01:10:42,263 --> 01:10:45,564
then most of their view is what other MVC's draw, so
但是多数情况下，它们的 view 是其它 MVC 绘制的内容，

1639
01:10:45,566 --> 01:10:50,235
the MVCs are part of their views.
所以其它 MVC 只是这些 controller 视图的一部分。

1640
01:10:50,237 --> 01:10:51,670
So let's look at TabBarController,
看看 TabBarController

1641
01:10:51,672 --> 01:10:53,471
it's probably the simplest one of all these.
它可能是三个中最简单的

1642
01:10:53,473 --> 01:10:55,006
You've seen TabBarControllers,
你们已经见过 TabBarControllers,

1643
01:10:55,008 --> 01:10:58,442
you see it's got the four tabs along the bottom on this one.
这个 TabBarController 底部罗列了四个 tab。

1644
01:10:58,444 --> 01:11:00,343
This is the health app, I think.
我觉得这个一个健康类的应用。

1645
01:11:02,814 --> 01:11:05,748
And all that happens here is when you click one of those
当你点击底部四个 tab button

1646
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:10,318
tab buttons at the bottom, the top gets replaced with an MVC.
中的一个，上面就会被一个新的 MVC 替换。

1647
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,987
An entire MVC is controlling that top.
整个 MVC 控制上面的内容。

1648
01:11:12,989 --> 01:11:16,457
In this case, it's some sort of dashboard MVC or health
在本例中，这上面要展现的是一个 MVC 的 dashboard（仪表盘）

1649
01:11:16,459 --> 01:11:20,494
dashboard is being presented at the top, right here.
或是一个 健康的 dashboard（仪表盘）。

1650
01:11:20,496 --> 01:11:22,195
And the icon and
dashboard（仪表盘）下面的 icon（图标）以及

1651
01:11:22,197 --> 01:11:25,699
the title that goes along with the dashboard down there,
title（标题）

1652
01:11:25,701 --> 01:11:29,468
is actually gotten from the dashboard MVC.
实际上来自这个 dashboard （仪表盘）MVC。

1653
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:31,804
In other words,
换句话说，icon 和 title

1654
01:11:31,805 --> 01:11:34,139
not a property you set on the UITabBarController MVC.
不是你在 UITabBarController MVC 中设置的 property（属性）。

1655
01:11:34,141 --> 01:11:37,109
You actually just have a property on
实际上在你的 dashboard MVC 中，

1656
01:11:37,111 --> 01:11:39,844
your dashboard MVC, it's called tabBarItem.
你仅有一个叫做 tabBarItem 的属性

1657
01:11:39,846 --> 01:11:42,847
And inside tabBarItem, if you go look it up in the doc,
在 tabBarItem 中， 如果你查找文档，

1658
01:11:42,849 --> 01:11:47,751
it's got things like title, icon, things that the tab bar
tabBarItem 中有 title（标题），icon（图标），等，这些东西

1659
01:11:47,753 --> 01:11:50,754
controller needs to put a nice tab on the bottom for
都是 tabBarController 需要的，用来为你的 dashboard底部

1660
01:11:50,756 --> 01:11:52,589
your dashboard MVC.
呈现一个适当的 tab。

1661
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:54,423
So, as you can see, it's very object oriented, okay.
可以看到，这非常符合面向对象的思想。

1662
01:11:54,426 --> 01:11:57,427
Everything is contained in just this MVC.
所有的东西都在这个 MVC 中。

1663
01:11:57,429 --> 01:11:59,395
And so, if you press on a different tab,
如果你按下另一个 tab，

1664
01:12:00,331 --> 01:12:02,064
maybe the second tab, then this is a totally
比如第二个 tab，然后

1665
01:12:02,066 --> 01:12:04,899
different MVC that takes over the top of this screen.
一个完全不同的MVC占据了屏幕的顶部。

1666
01:12:04,901 --> 01:12:08,269
This would be Health Data MVC, and you can see that it's got
这是 Health Data MVC, 可以看到

1667
01:12:08,271 --> 01:12:11,305
a different icon and text down there, right?
它有一个不同的 icon 和 title 在它下面，对吧？

1668
01:12:11,307 --> 01:12:13,374
By the way, if there's too
顺便说下，如果底部罗列了

1669
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:15,442
many tabs along the bottom there, I think you get five,
太多 tab，比如有5个tab，

1670
01:12:15,444 --> 01:12:19,479
if you go to six tabs then iOS will automatically let
如果你要六个 tab，那么iOS将会自动让

1671
01:12:19,481 --> 01:12:22,248
the user manage which ones he wants down there.
用户来决定他想要哪些tab。

1672
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:23,950
It's pretty cool, okay.
相当 cool，对吧。

1673
01:12:23,952 --> 01:12:25,168
So you don't even have to and
你可以在下面放

1674
01:12:25,169 --> 01:12:26,385
you can put as many tabs you want.
任意多的 tab。

1675
01:12:26,387 --> 01:12:27,720
I don't really recommend more than five
但是，我建议不超过五个。

1676
01:12:27,722 --> 01:12:28,720
tabs here, by the way.
顺便一说。

1677
01:12:30,257 --> 01:12:31,940
For users it's like, what,
对于用户来说情况可能是：“ 什么？

1678
01:12:31,941 --> 01:12:33,624
I have to manage my tabs down there, I don't wanna do that.
我还得自己管理 tab，我可不想这么玛法 ”。

1679
01:12:33,626 --> 01:12:35,259
It's just that you're asking yours to do more stuff.
这是自己给自己找麻烦。

1680
01:12:35,261 --> 01:12:36,827
So hopefully you can fit it in five.
所以希望5个 tab 可以满足你的要求。

1681
01:12:38,097 --> 01:12:40,330
And so we have other MVCs as well.
我们也有其它 MVC

1682
01:12:40,332 --> 01:12:43,266
So there's the sources of health data,
这个是 health data（健康数据）的来源，

1683
01:12:43,268 --> 01:12:45,701
I guess, in your Medical ID tab.
在你的 Medical ID tab.

1684
01:12:45,703 --> 01:12:48,871
And so this is a very simple thing you can understand.
这些东西都很容易理解

1685
01:12:48,873 --> 01:12:50,706
You've got this UITabBarController,
你得到了这个 UITabBarController

1686
01:12:50,708 --> 01:12:53,108
it's a controller of an MVC.
它是一个 MVC 的 controller.

1687
01:12:53,109 --> 01:12:55,509
The view is the little tabs along the bottom that it's
它的（UITabBarController）的 view 是底部的它绘制的这些 tab

1688
01:12:55,512 --> 01:12:57,645
drawing and the MVC's on the top.
以及顶部的 MVC。

1689
01:12:58,915 --> 01:13:00,915
Everyone understand what I
大家都明白我说的吗？

1690
01:13:00,916 --> 01:13:02,916
mean now about an MVC whose view contains other MVC's?
关于一个 MVC 的 view 包含其它 MVC。

1691
01:13:02,918 --> 01:13:06,686
So let's look at another one that does that.
好的，一起看一下另一个 的 controller。

1692
01:13:06,688 --> 01:13:08,121
SplitViewController.

1693
01:13:08,123 --> 01:13:11,157
So, SplitViewController takes two MVCs, and
SplitViewController 包括两个 MVC，

1694
01:13:11,159 --> 01:13:13,892
it puts them side-by-side, okay.
并将它们并排放在一起。

1695
01:13:13,894 --> 01:13:15,460
It puts the one on the left,
它将一个放在左边。

1696
01:13:15,462 --> 01:13:19,630
kind of a well known width there.
似乎是一个熟知的宽度

1697
01:13:19,632 --> 01:13:21,198
But, you don't care what that width is because,
但是，你不必关心宽度是多少，

1698
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,033
hopefully, you've got auto-layout, and so
你可以使用 auto-layout，

1699
01:13:23,035 --> 01:13:24,334
it could be any width you want, or
想让它多宽，

1700
01:13:24,336 --> 01:13:26,102
any height you want, like this.
想让它都高都可以，就像这样。

1701
01:13:26,104 --> 01:13:27,503
And then it puts another one on the right.
然后，它（UISplitViewController）将另一个 MVC 放在右边。

1702
01:13:27,505 --> 01:13:31,774
Now, we call the MVC on the left, the Master in
接下来，我们将左边的 MVC 叫做 split view 的 Master

1703
01:13:31,776 --> 01:13:34,576
the split view and we call the MVC on the right the Detail.
将右边的 MVC 叫做 Detail。

1704
01:13:38,615 --> 01:13:41,349
Now here I've got a calculator and a calculator graph.
目前我有一个计算器和一个计算器图表。

1705
01:13:41,351 --> 01:13:44,218
You assignment three is going to be to build this basically.
你们第三次作业基本上将要实现这个计算器。

1706
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:46,353
It doesn't have to look exactly like this, okay.
你们的计算器不必和我的完全一样。

1707
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:49,022
I've made a simple looking one here.
我只做了一个简单的外观。

1708
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:51,791
But it could look very much like this.
但是你们的作业可能和我展示的样子差不了多少。

1709
01:13:51,793 --> 01:13:53,292
But you do have to use a SplitViewController.
但是你必须使用一个 SplitViewController。

1710
01:13:53,294 --> 01:13:54,260
So this is what it looks like.
现在它就是这个样子。

1711
01:13:54,262 --> 01:13:58,897
Now, this is only happening on an iPad.
当然，只有在 iPad 上才会这样。

1712
01:13:58,899 --> 01:14:00,732
Now, when we talk about auto layout,
当我们说到 auto layout，

1713
01:14:00,734 --> 01:14:04,335
we're going to start talking about size classes.
我们就要从 size classes 开始说起。

1714
01:14:04,337 --> 01:14:07,304
So, different devices have been grouped into
各种不同尺寸的 iOS 设备

1715
01:14:07,306 --> 01:14:08,839
size classes.
都被集成到了 size classes 中。

1716
01:14:08,841 --> 01:14:13,410
And the sizes basically are regular, so regular width and
size 通常为 regular，regular width 和 regular height

1717
01:14:13,412 --> 01:14:16,512
regular height or compact width and height.
或者 compact width， compact height。
1721
01:14:16,514 --> 01:14:18,614
So an iPhone, all the iPhones except for
对于 iPhone 来说，除了在

1718
01:14:18,616 --> 01:14:21,083
the iPhone 6+ in landscape,
landscape（横向模式）的 iPhone 6+，

1719
01:14:21,085 --> 01:14:25,220
are compact both vertically and horizontally, okay.
在水平方向和竖直方向都是 compact。

1720
01:14:25,222 --> 01:14:28,656
The iPad is regular width, okay.
iPad 是 regular width。

1721
01:14:28,658 --> 01:14:30,458
Now, that's of the whole device.
这就是整个设备。

1722
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:35,829
But the MVC's inside also will have a certain size class.
但是设备里（iPad）的 MVC 同样有特定的 size class。

1723
01:14:35,831 --> 01:14:39,265
So this side by side business can only happen in
所以这样并排排列的 MVC 只能出现在

1724
01:14:39,267 --> 01:14:42,168
a device whose size class is regular width.
拥有 regular width 的 size class。

1725
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:46,238
So that's the iPad in both landscape and portrait could
所有只有 iPad 在 landscape（横向模式）和 portrait（纵向模式）是 regular width，

1726
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:49,941
be that, and the iPhone 6+ in landscape, okay.
iPhone 6+ 在 landscape（横向模式）下也是 regular width 。

1727
01:14:49,943 --> 01:14:52,977
So SplitView is only gonna do the side by
所以 SplitView 只能在这几种情况下并排放置。

1728
01:14:52,979 --> 01:14:55,013
side business there.
所以 SplitView 只能在这几种情况下并排放置。

1729
01:14:55,015 --> 01:15:01,352
And if you rotate the iPad, then the Master disappears.
如果你旋转 iPad，Master 消失了。

1730
01:15:02,521 --> 01:15:04,688
But it can be swiped out.
但是可以将 Master 滑动唤出。

1731
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:10,126
If you just swipe from the left, when you rotate the only
如果你从屏幕左边滑动，当 ipad 旋转时只有 Detail 视图，

1732
01:15:10,128 --> 01:15:12,361
ones there is the Detail, you don't see the Master.
看不到 Master。

1733
01:15:12,363 --> 01:15:14,129
But if you swipe out from the left,
但是如果你从左向右滑动，

1734
01:15:14,131 --> 01:15:15,830
then you get to see the Master as well.
你也可以看到 Master。

1735
01:15:15,832 --> 01:15:16,798
Again, side by side.
Master 和 Detail 又并排放在一起了。

1736
01:15:18,334 --> 01:15:19,633
Okay.

1737
01:15:19,635 --> 01:15:22,302
And if you touch the Detail, it'll make the Master go
如果你点击 Detail，会使 Master 返回消失

1738
01:15:22,304 --> 01:15:23,703
back away and then you can swipe it.
然后可以再次滑动唤出。

1739
01:15:23,705 --> 01:15:26,005
So you can bring the Master out or not, okay.
所以你可以决定是否唤出 Maser。

1740
01:15:26,007 --> 01:15:28,607
That make sense?
懂了吗？

1741
01:15:28,609 --> 01:15:30,609
So that's the SplitViewController,
以上是 SplitViewController
1746
01:15:30,611 --> 01:15:32,444
kind of how it's arranged.
以及它怎么排列。

1742
01:15:35,115 --> 01:15:37,915
But most importantly, I want you to understand that again,
最重要的是，我想让你们再次理解

1743
01:15:37,917 --> 01:15:40,217
it's two MVCs that are the view.
这两个 MVC 是 view。

1744
01:15:40,219 --> 01:15:43,653
Now the SplitView draws nothing in its view,
SplitView 并没有在它的 view 中绘制任何内容，

1745
01:15:44,656 --> 01:15:47,189
except for maybe that vertical separator line.
可能除了竖直的分界线。

1746
01:15:47,191 --> 01:15:48,590
Okay, there's a vertical separator line.
这条竖直的分界线。

1747
01:15:48,592 --> 01:15:52,327
That's probably drawn by the SplitViewController, but
可能是 SplitViewController 绘制的，

1748
01:15:52,329 --> 01:15:55,430
otherwise it's only drawing  whatever the MVCs draw.
但是，他只展示了 MVC 绘制的内容

1749
01:15:55,432 --> 01:15:57,131
So it doesn't even have any drawing on
所以，它甚至不像 tabBarViewController 那样

1750
01:15:57,133 --> 01:15:58,632
the bottom like the TabBar has.
绘制底部的 tabBar。

1751
01:15:59,735 --> 01:16:00,884
Okay?

1752
01:16:00,885 --> 01:16:02,034
So the next thing I'm going to talk about, and
下面我要讲到的，

1753
01:16:02,037 --> 01:16:03,903
we're going to start this next time,
以及我们要再下一节课继续讲的是

1754
01:16:03,905 --> 01:16:07,407
is NavigationController, which is a very powerful one.
NavigationController， 这是一个功能强大的 controller。

1755
01:16:07,409 --> 01:16:10,242
It draws at the top a little title and
它在顶部绘制小的 title 和其他东西，

1756
01:16:10,244 --> 01:16:12,277
some things, it can draw even around the bottom.
它甚至可以在底部周围绘制内容。

1757
01:16:12,279 --> 01:16:15,380
And then it can display any number of MVCs.
还有，它可以展示任意多的 MVC。

1758
01:16:15,382 --> 01:16:19,917
Okay, so we'll pick up the NavigationController next time
好的，下节课我们将要学习 NavigationController

1759
01:16:19,919 --> 01:16:22,219
and in the meantime if you have any questions,
如果你有任何问题要问，

1760
01:16:22,221 --> 01:16:23,053
I'll be here as usual.
我会像往常一样在这里解答。
