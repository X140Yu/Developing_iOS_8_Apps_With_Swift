00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:08,373
      Stanford University.

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,942
   >> All right, well,welcome
      to Stanford CS193P,

4
00:00:11,944 --> 00:00:13,377
        winter of 2015.

5
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:14,744
  This is lecture number two.

6
00:00:14,746 --> 00:00:18,581
   I apologize upfront for my
  terrible voice, we are going

7
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,549
   to try to get through this
     as best we can today.

8
00:00:22,153 --> 00:00:23,819
    Our topics are two fold.

9
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:25,854
     [COUGH] We're going to
    continue the calculator

10
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:29,924
 demo that we started, in last
  lecture and then we're gonna

11
00:00:29,926 --> 00:00:32,526
  have some slides about this
     model view controller,

12
00:00:32,528 --> 00:00:35,462
 object-oriented design pattern
    that we're gonna use in

13
00:00:35,464 --> 00:00:36,797
       everything we do.

14
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,066
   When we build applications
         in this class.

15
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:41,151
           All right?

16
00:00:41,152 --> 00:00:42,235
      So let's get started
        with that demo.

17
00:00:42,237 --> 00:00:44,136
   Again, here's a slide with
     the summary of kind of

18
00:00:44,138 --> 00:00:46,538
      the important things
    we're gonna talk about.

19
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,540
     You don't need to read
     those in advance here,

20
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:49,708
    it's more for reference.

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,410
     My slides in general,
          I post them,

22
00:00:52,412 --> 00:00:55,246
 it's mostly intended to almost
    be note taking for you.

23
00:00:55,248 --> 00:00:56,580
 To be able go back and try and

24
00:00:56,582 --> 00:00:58,515
   figure out, whoa, when did
   he talked about that day?

25
00:00:58,517 --> 00:00:59,382
            Oh yeah.

26
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:00,983
  What's important, et cetera.

27
00:01:00,985 --> 00:01:03,419
    So my slides do tend to
     be a little bit dense.

28
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:05,187
     I tend to put a little
      more on them, than,

29
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:06,989
    than just bullet items.

30
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,790
 But that's because I want you
  to be able to look back and

31
00:01:08,792 --> 00:01:11,726
   kind of get just a little
       bit more depth to

32
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:14,162
      remind yourself what
        I talked about.

33
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:15,363
             Okay?

34
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:17,882
         All right, so

35
00:01:17,883 --> 00:01:20,400
 this demo, if you'll remember
 last time, where we left off,

36
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:23,603
    we had gotten the keypad
         fully working.

37
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:26,606
 All right, and we were talking
 a little bit about properties

38
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:28,808
   and instant variables and
 how we had to initialize them.

39
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,710
      And so I'm gonna ask
      a question right at

40
00:01:30,712 --> 00:01:33,012
      the end of lecture,
        perfect timing.

41
00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:37,248
     What about the little
   outlet that we dragged out

42
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,284
     that display UI label
 exclamation point, how come we

43
00:01:40,286 --> 00:01:43,888
    didn't have to make that
 equal to something, to start.

44
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,123
     And that's where this
     demo is gonna pick up.

45
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:46,890
             Okay?

46
00:01:46,892 --> 00:01:49,759
            >> Okay.

47
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,627
 [COUGH] Well, let's dive back
    into this demonstration,

48
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,647
       where we left off.

49
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,665
       Which it was this
      line of code, here.

50
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:59,868
 And, we had just talked about
    the fact that we have to

51
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,572
     initialize all of our
 variables [COUGH] in a class,

52
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:05,807
         in any class.

53
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:09,510
   And, so that's why we need
    this equals falls here.

54
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:13,747
  They wanted the equal falls
  too but we needed it and yet

55
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:15,482
      it didn't seem like
      we needed one here.

56
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:17,050
       And why was that?

57
00:02:17,052 --> 00:02:19,085
       Well, it turns out
     that this right here,

58
00:02:19,087 --> 00:02:22,254
  even though it doesn't quite
 look like one, is an optional.

59
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,559
  And, optionals automatically
 get equaled nil, given to you.

60
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:31,862
  So, you don't actually have
  to put the equals nil here.

61
00:02:31,864 --> 00:02:35,365
   So that's why, so this one
  here is getting initialized.

62
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:37,600
      It's just being done
     automatically for you.

63
00:02:37,602 --> 00:02:39,635
     But, let's talk about
    the look of this thing.

64
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:43,772
         It's got this
    exclamation point here.

65
00:02:43,774 --> 00:02:45,040
  And, if it were an optional,

66
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:47,208
      you'd be used to it
    having a question mark.

67
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,310
    For example, we look at
   this optional right here,

68
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:51,028
         current title,

69
00:02:51,029 --> 00:02:52,745
  you see it's string question
  mark not exclamation point,

70
00:02:52,748 --> 00:02:54,665
         question mark.

71
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,583
    So what's the difference
  between a question mark and

72
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:58,551
   an exclamation point here?

73
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,570
       And the answer is,

74
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,588
   it makes no difference to
  the actual type, it's still

75
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,958
    an optional whose value
   here could be a UI label.

76
00:03:07,161 --> 00:03:09,761
       But it matters on
        the usage of it.

77
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:12,597
          [COUGH] And
  this is purely just kind of

78
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,466
       a compiler helping
      you out thing, here.

79
00:03:16,502 --> 00:03:18,602
       But if we look at
     when I change this to

80
00:03:18,604 --> 00:03:21,538
  a question mark you see that
 some errors appear down here.

81
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,940
 So then let's click on one of
  these errors, like this one,

82
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:26,208
        and you can see
   the errors that UI label,

83
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,244
     question mark does not
   have a member named text.

84
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:31,279
       In other words you
        can't send text.

85
00:03:31,281 --> 00:03:32,580
    UI label question mark,

86
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:35,350
 which is what this is and that
  makes sense because UI label

87
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:36,784
        question mark is
        an optional and

88
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:39,453
     obviously an optional
    doesn't respond to text.

89
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:42,889
       UI labels do, but
        optionals don't.

90
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:44,858
     So, why are we getting
     this error now when we

91
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,726
   weren't getting it before.

92
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:47,993
      And how would we get
       rid of this error?

93
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,461
        Well, you could
      certainly get rid of

94
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,630
   this error by just putting
   an exclamation point here,

95
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:54,399
       that would unwrap
         this optional.

96
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,734
     And now this would be
   an UI label right here and

97
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,819
      we can send a text.

98
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,903
       And we do the same
         thing up here.

99
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:03,073
   We can unwrap it there and
    we can unwrap it there.

100
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:05,742
      And that gets rid of
       all of our errors.

101
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:09,012
  But [COUGH] this kind of an
  interesting property in that

102
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:11,213
        even though it's
       not initialized in

103
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:14,450
     the very beginning of
 a colossus creation starts out

104
00:04:14,452 --> 00:04:16,451
        as nil not set.

105
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:21,723
    As soon as as this user
    interface gets loaded up

106
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:23,891
    by this new controller.

107
00:04:23,893 --> 00:04:26,794
    Then this gets wired up,
     alright, so, that gets

108
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:30,497
 wired up, and this is set, and
  then this it's set forever.

109
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:33,199
  So it's really, kinda would
     be sad if we actually,

110
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:36,536
   every time we used it had
   to unwrap it all the time.

111
00:04:36,538 --> 00:04:38,437
        So these kind of
        properties that.

112
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:42,674
   Get set very early, maybe
   not right at creation like

113
00:04:42,676 --> 00:04:44,976
      this one, but very,
  they get set very early, and

114
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:46,511
         then they stay
       set all the time.

115
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:49,030
      You can, instead of

116
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:50,614
    putting a question mark
      in their decoration.

117
00:04:50,616 --> 00:04:52,683
      We're talking about
     their decoration here.

118
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:54,317
          You can put
     an exclamation point.

119
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,586
     And what that says is.

120
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,521
 This is just an optional, but

121
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:03,625
  always automatically unwrap
  it so that you don't have to

122
00:05:03,627 --> 00:05:06,261
      put this exclamation
         point in here.

123
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:07,695
         So I take this
     exclamation point out.

124
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:09,764
     You can see, it's not
     generating any errors.

125
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:15,735
    And it's still going to
    unwrap this display and

126
00:05:15,737 --> 00:05:17,670
     turn into a UI label.

127
00:05:17,672 --> 00:05:18,838
              And.

128
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,006
     It's still gonna crash
      your program if for

129
00:05:21,008 --> 00:05:22,307
          some reason
     the display were nil.

130
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:25,110
    If you tried to execute
      this code, that may

131
00:05:25,112 --> 00:05:28,146
   be impossible because this
  is the button sending those.

132
00:05:28,148 --> 00:05:31,716
 So the button wouldn't be here
 if this hadn't gotten already

133
00:05:31,718 --> 00:05:33,818
     loaded up in the set.

134
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:35,919
  But if somehow you had some
  place in your controller or

135
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:39,589
   you were accessing display
   before this UI got loaded.

136
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:42,158
        It would crash,
 because it is unwrapping this,

137
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,327
 it's just that you don't have
 to put the explanation point,

138
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:46,629
      it's kinda like auto
       explanation point.

139
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:51,066
     And, this is called a
 implicitly unwrapped optional.

140
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:53,968
             Okay?
 Implicitly unwrapped optional.

141
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,704
  And it's really only useful
  for this kind, of property,

142
00:05:56,706 --> 00:06:00,274
  that's, set very early, and
    then stay set, forever.

143
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,642
  It's kind of sugar, really.

144
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:07,246
     Okay, so let's move on

145
00:06:07,248 --> 00:06:11,117
     to the next button in
     our [INAUDIBLE] here.

146
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:13,285
       Which is going to
      be an enter button.

147
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:16,655
    Now our calculator does
    not have an equals sign.

148
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:18,223
    So you're probably used
    to calculators where you

149
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:21,726
  say six plus three then when
  you hit equals it shows you

150
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:23,027
          the result.

151
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:24,912
       This calculator is

152
00:06:24,913 --> 00:06:26,796
       a little more like
    a scientific calculator.

153
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:27,564
       Has an enter key.

154
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:31,668
    And so, instead you put
 the numbers you want to add or

155
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,671
 divide or multiply or whatever
 onto a stack and then when you

156
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:38,440
  press the operation keys it
   pulls them off the stack.

157
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:43,011
    So that looks like this,
        6 enter 3 times.

158
00:06:43,013 --> 00:06:45,279
       Four, six, enter,
      three, enter, times.

159
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:48,449
     So the times is going
      to pull the six and

160
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:50,735
    the three off the stack.

161
00:06:50,736 --> 00:06:53,020
 You could even go six, enter,
 five, enter, four, enter, and

162
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:54,521
      then go times plus.

163
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,624
  That would multiply the top
      two on the stack and

164
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,893
   then add the last one on.

165
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:04,629
    So we need an enter key
    here for our calculator.

166
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:06,798
   Now, I'm gonna create that
   enter key in a way that's

167
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,367
 actually gonna cause a problem
    for me in a moment, but

168
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:12,370
    I wanna show you how to
   resolve that very problem.

169
00:07:12,372 --> 00:07:16,039
 So I'm gonna create this enter
  key by copying and pasting.

170
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,608
   This digit key right here.

171
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,475
       And I'm just gonna
        put it in here.

172
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:20,743
 Notice that I'm lining these,

173
00:07:22,113 --> 00:07:23,745
         blue lines up
     absolutely perfectly.

174
00:07:23,747 --> 00:07:27,315
 I don't want them to be, like
  it's lined up with that one,

175
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:28,750
      but not that one or
          vice versa.

176
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:30,685
          I want them
      perfectly lined up.

177
00:07:30,687 --> 00:07:33,520
   Cuz later I'm gonna spread
  these out over the whole UI

178
00:07:33,522 --> 00:07:37,057
  and if I haven't lined these
  up just absolutely perfectly

179
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:39,693
  then Expo's not gonna quite
    know what I want here in

180
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:41,828
   terms of the relationship
         between these.

181
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:46,999
  All right so we don't want a
 three on here, we want to have

182
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:52,237
 a,enter symbol so I'm gonna go
 up here to special characters.

183
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:54,505
       This is on in most
       Mac applications.

184
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:57,174
  You can go to the edit menu
   to get special characters.

185
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,342
  And I'm going to search for

186
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,510
   this one actually, I think
    that's called a return.

187
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:01,945
             Yeah.
       And these are just

188
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:04,614
 Unicode characters right here.

189
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:06,615
             And so
  I want this one that looks,

190
00:08:06,617 --> 00:08:09,551
    kind of like a return or
           enter key.

191
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:11,686
        So I have this.

192
00:08:11,688 --> 00:08:13,721
   And I'm gonna use the same
   mechanism we used before,

193
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:14,822
      which is CTRL+drag.

194
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:18,958
       So I'm just gonna
      CTRL+drag out here.

195
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,027
 And, we're creating an action,

196
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:24,196
  of course, cuz we want this
  button to send us a message.

197
00:08:24,198 --> 00:08:25,431
    I'm gonna call it Enter.

198
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,333
       That's what it is
        the answer key.

199
00:08:28,335 --> 00:08:30,134
        Now one thing is
   different about this one,

200
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:32,470
    if you'll remember when
    we wired this action up,

201
00:08:32,472 --> 00:08:35,906
   we had the button that was
 sending it as an argument and

202
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:37,441
 we don't want that this time.

203
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:38,808
      Because there's only
       one answer key we

204
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,977
   really don't need to talk
   back to the answer key, so

205
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,712
       we're going to say
        none right here.

206
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:45,714
 It also doesn't really matter
 about this type because we're

207
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:46,948
       not going to have
         an argument so

208
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,750
       it doesn't matter
       what this type is.

209
00:08:48,752 --> 00:08:49,717
      So disconnect that.

210
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,686
   As you can see right here.

211
00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:54,154
       We have Enter, and
      it has no arguments.

212
00:08:55,691 --> 00:08:57,690
     Now, what are we gonna
        do inside Enter?

213
00:08:57,692 --> 00:08:59,558
      Well, the main thing
       we need to do is,

214
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,228
     put whatever number is
    in this display up here,

215
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,697
 okay, onto our internal stack.

216
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:06,931
      So, we're gonna need

217
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:09,367
       an internal stack,
       in a moment, here.

218
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:10,868
        Another thing we
      might wanna do, is.

219
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:14,604
   Set users in the middle of
  typing the number to false.

220
00:09:14,606 --> 00:09:17,507
     Because we might have
   been typing a number, but

221
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:20,343
    as soon as we hit enter,
 we're putting it on the stack.

222
00:09:20,345 --> 00:09:21,977
   Next time we type a digit,

223
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,846
       we're going to be
     starting a new number.

224
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:27,182
  [COUGH] All right, so we'll
   call that user [NOISE] in

225
00:09:27,184 --> 00:09:29,451
         the middle of
      typing falls there.

226
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:32,387
    Now, let's go ahead and,
   and actually run this and

227
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:33,788
    see how this is working.

228
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,991
    Because there's going to
   be a little problem here.

229
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:44,197
         So, run this.

230
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:47,499
          Alright, so
    let's try eight, enter.

231
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:48,367
              Oh.

232
00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:50,001
          What's that?
          Oh, my god.

233
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:52,337
          Six, enter.

234
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:54,672
    Well it's, it's kind of
    working because after we

235
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:57,241
   press enter the user is in
 the middle of typing numbers.

236
00:09:57,243 --> 00:09:59,160
          Starts over.

237
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:01,078
      So that's good, but
     I had no intention for

238
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,380
    this to be showing up on
     the end of my display.

239
00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:05,115
       This little enter.

240
00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:06,749
        What the heck is
      that doing on there?

241
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:07,783
     Why is that happening?

242
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:09,951
    Let's take a look here.

243
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:15,023
  The problem here, has to do
 with the messages being sent.

244
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:17,358
   So, when we wire this up,
          that's good.

245
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,161
         We got enter.

246
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,963
   The problem is that button
    also sends a pen digit.

247
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:25,598
  That's because we copied and
  pasted this three, remember?

248
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,735
   And the three sends a pen
    digit, until we copy and

249
00:10:28,737 --> 00:10:29,903
           paste it.

250
00:10:29,904 --> 00:10:31,070
      Now, this one sends,
       sends a pen digit.

251
00:10:31,072 --> 00:10:32,805
        So this is both.

252
00:10:32,807 --> 00:10:34,874
       Okay, sending two.

253
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,942
      Now, that's a common
        mistake to make.

254
00:10:36,944 --> 00:10:39,744
    You know, you only think
  about that when you copy and

255
00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:41,145
           paste it.

256
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:42,947
    And how do we fix this?

257
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:44,348
  Well if you right click, so

258
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,717
       I'm going to right
     click on this button.

259
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:48,885
        You'll get this
     window that comes up.

260
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:51,687
      And it shows you all
   the connections from this

261
00:10:52,723 --> 00:10:54,189
    UY element to your code.

262
00:10:54,191 --> 00:10:57,025
      And you can see here
       both appendage and

263
00:10:57,027 --> 00:10:58,826
      enter are connected.

264
00:10:58,828 --> 00:11:01,562
 The great thing is I can just
 click this little X right here

265
00:11:01,564 --> 00:11:03,530
      and it'll take this
        connection away.

266
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,232
   So now I only have enter.

267
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:08,101
   So now if I go back here.

268
00:11:08,103 --> 00:11:09,853
           See it's,

269
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:11,604
  it's not sending appendage,
      it is sending enter.

270
00:11:11,606 --> 00:11:14,440
   And you can do this right
     clicking for anything.

271
00:11:14,442 --> 00:11:16,608
   Like we need to do it for
       our label up here.

272
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,112
    See there's the display
 connection we have right here.

273
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:24,448
  So don't forget right click
     to disconnect things.

274
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,918
    Now if you forget about
   this and you don't do it.

275
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,455
 Or maybe you have it wired to
  some thing that you change.

276
00:11:32,457 --> 00:11:35,391
    For example, if we have
  accidentally put an argument

277
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:40,062
 here to enter, if we had made
 it do descending button trick,

278
00:11:40,064 --> 00:11:42,064
       kind of like this.

279
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:44,432
  You can't just say, oh okay.

280
00:11:44,434 --> 00:11:45,066
         I'll fix that.

281
00:11:45,068 --> 00:11:46,667
     I'll just delete that.

282
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:49,136
       Because that would
       not work because,

283
00:11:49,138 --> 00:11:52,072
     enter with an argument
    is actually a different

284
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:54,774
       message than enter
       with no argument.

285
00:11:54,776 --> 00:11:57,510
  And so, if you just deleted
   that when you were running

286
00:11:57,512 --> 00:11:58,978
        your program it
        would crash and

287
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,581
     it would say, couldn't
   send message enter colon.

288
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,150
   When you touch this button
 cause enter colon means enter

289
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:08,853
 with an argument, only for the
 purpose of this tour It doe-,

290
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:10,655
       we don't see enter
       colon in our code.

291
00:12:10,657 --> 00:12:12,656
 That's just something that's,
     this story board here.

292
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:17,661
  So if that happens, you need
   to right click on here and

293
00:12:17,663 --> 00:12:21,431
  disconnect the enter colon,
   that happened in there and

294
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:23,566
 then you just recontrol drag.

295
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:25,834
       When you recontrol
    drag it's nice it will.

296
00:12:25,836 --> 00:12:28,103
     Kind of let you try to
    grab onto something, so

297
00:12:28,105 --> 00:12:32,373
     its easy to reconnect.

298
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,293
              Kay?

299
00:12:35,294 --> 00:12:38,212
  All right, so now we want to
 actually implement enter here.

300
00:12:38,214 --> 00:12:41,248
        We want to enter
        the guts of it.

301
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,150
  And so we are going to need
 another property here which is

302
00:12:44,152 --> 00:12:45,702
        going to be that

303
00:12:45,703 --> 00:12:47,253
   internal stack that these
  numbers are going to go on.

304
00:12:47,255 --> 00:12:52,057
      And so that's gonna
       be a var just like

305
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:54,393
     this var up here that
       we've created and

306
00:12:54,395 --> 00:12:57,562
   I'm call it operand stack
   that's a good name for it.

307
00:12:57,564 --> 00:12:58,730
  And it's gonna have a type,

308
00:12:58,732 --> 00:13:02,233
       it's type is going
       to be an array and

309
00:13:02,235 --> 00:13:05,869
  just like in other languages
  like Java when you specify,

310
00:13:05,871 --> 00:13:08,805
    when you create an array
   type you have to specify.

311
00:13:08,807 --> 00:13:10,840
       What kind of thing
        is in the array.

312
00:13:10,842 --> 00:13:15,211
     And so, I'm gonna put
      doubles in my array.

313
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:20,782
  And that's, even though you
    might say, well we can't

314
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:25,286
  enter doubles, because these
  are all integers, basically.

315
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:29,723
     But if I were to say,
  3 enter 6 divide, I get .5.

316
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,925
 So than a double would appear.

317
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:34,661
       So that's why I'm
      going to use double.

318
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:38,964
  Now, you can see that we've
 got this error up here again.

319
00:13:38,966 --> 00:13:41,133
    It says stored property
     operandStack does not

320
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:43,368
      have initial value.

321
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,036
       So we have to give
     this an initial value.

322
00:13:45,038 --> 00:13:47,071
      So I'm going to give
    this an initial value of

323
00:13:47,073 --> 00:13:48,472
        an empty array.

324
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:51,608
  So now you're seeing for the
  first time how you actually.

325
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:57,480
     Create an instance of
   a class or of a data type.

326
00:13:57,482 --> 00:14:00,249
    And you do that just by
    specifying the type and

327
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:01,984
     then use parenthesis.

328
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:03,752
        Now, we're not,

329
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:05,554
    again we haven't talked
      about initializers.

330
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:06,888
           A class or

331
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,390
   a data structure can have
     multiple initializers.

332
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:11,158
       Some of them might
    have arguments in here.

333
00:14:12,128 --> 00:14:16,863
   But most, if it's possible
      they'll allow you to

334
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:21,133
      create them with no
   arguments and in a case on

335
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:22,835
      our right it's very
      obvious what to do.

336
00:14:22,837 --> 00:14:25,103
   No arguments just creates
     an empty array right,

337
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:27,739
    with no elements in it.

338
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:31,142
 Now, one thing I want to talk
   about is this right here.

339
00:14:31,144 --> 00:14:32,376
      This type, you know?

340
00:14:32,378 --> 00:14:34,078
   It's kind of annoying that
    we have to type this and

341
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,147
      then we have to type
        it right again.

342
00:14:36,148 --> 00:14:38,215
       And the answer is,
   we don't have to do that,

343
00:14:38,217 --> 00:14:41,051
       because in swift,
 swift is very strongly typed.

344
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:43,252
      You know there's all
       the variables, but

345
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:45,221
         the properties
      are strongly typed.

346
00:14:45,223 --> 00:14:48,724
     But they, there's also
    a lot of type inference.

347
00:14:48,726 --> 00:14:50,625
      So swift can infer.

348
00:14:50,627 --> 00:14:53,995
  This type in the exact same
 way that digit had no type and

349
00:14:53,997 --> 00:14:55,596
   it inferred it from here.

350
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:58,366
  OperandStack, we don't have
   to specify they type, and

351
00:14:58,368 --> 00:14:59,633
   it can infer it from here.

352
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:02,302
   And if we option click on
  operandStack you'll see that

353
00:15:02,304 --> 00:15:05,271
 indeed, it's figured out that
   that's an array of double.

354
00:15:05,273 --> 00:15:07,824
          And in fact,

355
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:10,376
    putting the type in here
    is considered bad form.

356
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:14,080
     If it can be inferred,
  you should let it infer, so,

357
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:16,915
 if we didn't have this blue up
 here we shouldn't that either,

358
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:21,419
 because, false, and true are,
  can only be blue values so,

359
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,887
        we're gonna take
       that off as well.

360
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:28,025
    Okay, so, now, our brand

361
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,994
     stack right here what
    do we wanna do with it?

362
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:34,597
   Well, when we press enter,
    we just want to append.

363
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,798
          So, append.

364
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,034
   This is actually the first
  time we're sending an actual

365
00:15:39,036 --> 00:15:41,703
      message to an object
    looks just like when we

366
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:43,738
      accessed a property.

367
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,375
 The dot and it's just the name
    of the method that we're

368
00:15:47,377 --> 00:15:49,110
        trying to invoke
         in our arrays.

369
00:15:49,112 --> 00:15:51,478
 Just an array, an array method
    right here called a pen.

370
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,414
 I think you see the arguments
       as newElement: T.

371
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,517
     This : T means it has
      to be of this type.

372
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,853
 Type of things in the array so
    this has to be a double.

373
00:16:00,855 --> 00:16:04,223
  So that's kind of a problem,
   cuz really what I want to

374
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:08,060
 append onto my stack is what's
 up here in this display text.

375
00:16:08,062 --> 00:16:11,830
   And, you know, I'd like to
 say something along the lines

376
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:13,164
        of display.text.

377
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,099
             Okay?
     But what type is this?

378
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:16,767
    I can type display.text.

379
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:19,936
     Now that's not string.

380
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,205
      That is an optional.

381
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:24,874
   Remember that display.text
        is an optional.

382
00:16:24,876 --> 00:16:28,043
        So we can unwrap
         it even though

383
00:16:28,045 --> 00:16:29,911
        that's not gonna
       solve the problem.

384
00:16:29,913 --> 00:16:31,212
   This is still a string and

385
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:33,381
      you're still seeing
         an error here.

386
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:36,217
     The same string is not
 convertible to double [COUGH].

387
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:37,651
     Because we're supposed
    to be putting doubles in

388
00:16:37,653 --> 00:16:39,086
  this array putting strings.

389
00:16:39,088 --> 00:16:40,987
  So, we have a problem here.

390
00:16:40,989 --> 00:16:44,323
   We have somehow to convert
  this string into a double so

391
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:45,358
  we can put it on this stack.

392
00:16:46,394 --> 00:16:48,994
         I'm gonna use
       this opportunity.

393
00:16:48,996 --> 00:16:51,129
     Just show you another
        feature which we

394
00:16:51,131 --> 00:16:52,930
   call Computed Properties.

395
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:56,000
  So I'm gonna create another
   property display value and

396
00:16:56,002 --> 00:16:57,401
    it's gonna be a double.

397
00:16:57,403 --> 00:17:00,671
   And what I want this to be
 equal to is, I always want it

398
00:17:00,673 --> 00:17:03,773
    to be whatever's in this
 display converted to a double.

399
00:17:04,742 --> 00:17:05,786
             Okay?
         And I want to

400
00:17:05,787 --> 00:17:06,831
 be able to set it or get it so

401
00:17:06,832 --> 00:17:07,876
    I'm gonna be able to get
   the value of this double.

402
00:17:07,878 --> 00:17:10,112
   I just want to be able to
     set it as a double and

403
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:11,413
    have it turn into text.

404
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:15,616
       Well, that kind of

405
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:19,886
   property really is tied to
   some data somewhere else.

406
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:22,756
  So, I don't ever want to set
 it equal to some initial value

407
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:25,125
         or something.

408
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:27,493
 Really, I want it to always be
 calculated and we can do that.

409
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:29,295
       Instead of saying
       equals something,

410
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:32,364
       you just put curly
         braces after.

411
00:17:32,366 --> 00:17:37,168
       And you say, get,
        and we say, set.

412
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,871
             Okay?

413
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:42,573
  And inside here we are gonna
   compute the value of this.

414
00:17:42,575 --> 00:17:46,010
     Which is we are gonna
   convert this display text

415
00:17:46,012 --> 00:17:49,479
  to a double and then inside
  here, we are, someone said,

416
00:17:49,481 --> 00:17:52,449
 display value equal something
      and we are going to

417
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:55,251
        somehow compute,
  not really compute it, but.

418
00:17:55,253 --> 00:17:58,854
    We're gonna de, decide,
 what code we need to put that

419
00:17:58,856 --> 00:18:02,024
 number that they tried to set
 the display value to in here.

420
00:18:03,126 --> 00:18:05,393
            'Kay, so
  let's do the set side first.

421
00:18:05,395 --> 00:18:07,695
         It's actually
       a little simpler.

422
00:18:07,697 --> 00:18:08,929
        Inside this set,

423
00:18:08,931 --> 00:18:11,231
    there's a magic variable
       called new value.

424
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,901
  It doesn't, it's not purple
     for some reason, but.

425
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:16,235
       New value in this,
     this is the new value.

426
00:18:16,237 --> 00:18:17,903
       So if someone says
     somewhere in our code,

427
00:18:17,905 --> 00:18:19,338
   display value equals five,

428
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,306
      this new value will
         have the five.

429
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:23,541
  And so all I really wanna do

430
00:18:23,543 --> 00:18:26,276
    here is say display text
     equals the new value.

431
00:18:26,278 --> 00:18:30,480
   But again, of course this
     is an optional string.

432
00:18:30,482 --> 00:18:33,216
  You can't set it to a double
  because displayValue equals

433
00:18:33,218 --> 00:18:36,419
     five, this new values
     going to be a double.

434
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:41,557
   But we know how to convert
    something to a string by

435
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:45,260
  using backlash parenthesis.

436
00:18:45,262 --> 00:18:48,129
      And this is the same
      thing we did when we

437
00:18:48,131 --> 00:18:51,399
      printed out [COUGH]
       our digit up here.

438
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:53,501
      We just use the back
       slash parenthesis.

439
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:55,336
      It tries to convert
    this thing inside here,

440
00:18:55,338 --> 00:18:57,938
     which is a double into
      a string of doubles.

441
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,540
       You know how to do
        that themselves.

442
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:02,575
         And so bingo,
 we've got our display text and

443
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:04,477
   that's all that necessary.

444
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:07,479
 also, every time someone sets
   this value and then we're

445
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:10,282
   clearly not in the middle
  of typing a number anymore.

446
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:14,085
     [INAUDIBLE] Say that.

447
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:17,221
     [INAUDIBLE] All right,
    what about the getting?

448
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:19,290
       Now in the getting
      all we have to do is

449
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,258
   return this display value.

450
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,161
      So it's do something
     to calculate what this

451
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,363
     display value is here.

452
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,215
      And then return it.

453
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:31,032
      Now this one I'm not
     gonna take time to go

454
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:32,801
   through the details here.

455
00:19:32,803 --> 00:19:37,205
  And actually I've made it an
 extra credit item that you can

456
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:40,008
       do, which requires
       you to figure out

457
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,345
    what I'm gonna type here
    using the documentation.

458
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:45,879
       But I'm not going
      to explain it here.

459
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:49,382
  I'm gonna use a class that's
   in this number formatter.

460
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:52,051
       I'm actually gonna
         create one and

461
00:19:52,053 --> 00:19:56,822
  I'm gonna use a method on it
   called number from string.

462
00:19:57,858 --> 00:19:59,624
     And I'm gonna give it
      this string which is

463
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:02,593
    the display values text,
      unwrapped of course.

464
00:20:03,596 --> 00:20:06,497
 The result is acting optional
   so I'm gonna unwrap that.

465
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:09,499
   And then I'm gonna get the
  double value of the thing I

466
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,067
       get back [COUGH].

467
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:12,634
      Number gives me this
   kind of generic number so

468
00:20:12,637 --> 00:20:14,637
     I am gonna take it and
     turn it into a double.

469
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:15,738
        So there we go.

470
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:16,838
         So you can go
      the next spread and

471
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,374
       look at that later
          if you want.

472
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,959
    But surprising to say we

473
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,509
  now have a property display
 value that when we set it and

474
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,579
     get it, it's gonna be
      setting and getting.

475
00:20:24,581 --> 00:20:27,415
    It has a string here, so
   that is really convenient.

476
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:29,400
         Especially for

477
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:31,384
      right here, where we
    wanna say display value.

478
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:32,285
             'Kay?

479
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:33,953
    So let's see the double.

480
00:20:33,955 --> 00:20:34,987
          No problem.

481
00:20:34,989 --> 00:20:37,256
       We're pinning that
       onto operandStack.

482
00:20:37,258 --> 00:20:40,058
     So let's print in our
       operandStack here.

483
00:20:42,362 --> 00:20:45,162
 Just so, I mean we can do the
 same thing here, operandStack.

484
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:48,649
             Okay?

485
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,667
    And this worked because
 operandStack is an array, and

486
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:53,636
    arrays know how to turn
    themselves into strings.

487
00:20:53,638 --> 00:20:55,938
 You'll see how they do that in
 the console in a moment here.

488
00:20:56,874 --> 00:20:58,040
     So let's go ahead and

489
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:00,842
   see if our application is
   actually putting things on

490
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,343
    our stack properly here.

491
00:21:04,547 --> 00:21:14,054
            [NOISE]
           All right.

492
00:21:14,056 --> 00:21:14,854
        Let's try here.

493
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:18,591
      Let's try 56 enter.

494
00:21:18,593 --> 00:21:21,761
     And look, operandStack
     equals 56 doing good.

495
00:21:21,763 --> 00:21:23,128
          Seven enter.

496
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,429
    All right, 56.0 and 7.0.

497
00:21:24,431 --> 00:21:27,699
  So, you can see that arrays
  turn themselves into strings

498
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:30,735
  by doing open square bracket
   and then they turn each of

499
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:33,937
  their elements into strings
    and separated by commas.

500
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:37,207
       Now this is good.

501
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:39,642
     So we got our operand,
  operandStack building here.

502
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:44,713
  So all we need to do is have
   some times, and plus, and

503
00:21:44,715 --> 00:21:45,947
   minus buttons, et cetera.

504
00:21:45,949 --> 00:21:47,549
 I'm gonna put them right here.

505
00:21:47,551 --> 00:21:50,385
   That will operate on these
     items uh,on the stack.

506
00:21:50,387 --> 00:21:52,119
        So, if I pressed
        plus right now,

507
00:21:52,121 --> 00:21:55,122
  it would pull the seven and
    the eight off the stack.

508
00:21:55,124 --> 00:21:57,057
       Add them together,
        it would be 15.

509
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:58,758
     Show that 15 here, and

510
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,560
      it actually will put
   the 15 back on the stack.

511
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:03,696
   So then, we'd have 56 and
        15 on our stack.

512
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:04,863
     Then we could, maybe.

513
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:08,400
    Plus those together and
  we wanted by it plus again.

514
00:22:08,402 --> 00:22:08,933
           All right?

515
00:22:08,935 --> 00:22:12,036
         [COUGH] Okay.

516
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:15,539
  So how are we gonna do that?

517
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,040
      Well, we would make
       our buttons here.

518
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:22,245
 And I'm gonna make the buttons
      again by copying and

519
00:22:22,247 --> 00:22:24,580
    pasting a digit button.

520
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:26,648
      But this time I know
      about that problem,

521
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,584
    so right off the bat I'm
    gonna right click on it.

522
00:22:29,586 --> 00:22:31,353
  And disconnect appendage it.

523
00:22:31,355 --> 00:22:34,472
             Okay?
               So

524
00:22:34,473 --> 00:22:37,590
    now this button sends no
     messages, yet anyway.

525
00:22:37,593 --> 00:22:40,461
       And then we could
      put a type on here.

526
00:22:40,463 --> 00:22:44,331
 So here I'm gonna have my all
   my operations buttons use

527
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,000
 mathematical symbols so if we
 go down here to math symbols.

528
00:22:47,002 --> 00:22:49,936
      See there's a bunch
     of math symbols here.

529
00:22:49,938 --> 00:22:51,737
 So let's do times, right here,

530
00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:56,775
  first, we'll put times right
 there, and we can wire it up.

531
00:22:56,777 --> 00:22:59,511
    I'm just gonna hold that
    Ctrl and drag out here.

532
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,881
        We're gonna call
      this action method.

533
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,549
            Operate.

534
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:09,052
   And because I'm gonna have
 multiple operation buttons and

535
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,588
       they're all going
        to send operate.

536
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,289
        Just like I did
       with append digit,

537
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,457
 I am going to use the sender.

538
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:18,193
      So I'm gonna be very
   careful to change this any

539
00:23:18,195 --> 00:23:19,661
      object to be button.

540
00:23:20,697 --> 00:23:22,129
      Do not forget that.

541
00:23:22,131 --> 00:23:24,965
        'Kay, so action,
 we are gonna have it centered.

542
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:25,932
           UIButton.

543
00:23:25,934 --> 00:23:26,666
        Call it operate.

544
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:28,868
          There it is.

545
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,269
  That's method doing operate.

546
00:23:31,338 --> 00:23:33,438
        We can copy and
 paste this button now, right?

547
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,639
      We got this one, so

548
00:23:34,641 --> 00:23:37,775
    let's copy and paste and
    make some more of these.

549
00:23:37,777 --> 00:23:41,778
      We'll start out with
    four of them, let's say.

550
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,680
             'Kay?

551
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:45,581
       Let's get back our
    special characters here.

552
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:51,087
     [COUGH] All right, so
 let's make this one be divide.

553
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:53,522
   Let's make this one plus.

554
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:55,924
     And this one be minus.

555
00:23:55,926 --> 00:23:58,660
           All right.

556
00:23:58,662 --> 00:24:00,461
       So we've got these
        buttons [COUGH].

557
00:24:00,463 --> 00:24:02,930
    And they're all sending,
    if we look at this here,

558
00:24:02,932 --> 00:24:04,598
  they're all sending operate.

559
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:08,535
  Luckily, they're not sending
  anything except operate, so

560
00:24:08,537 --> 00:24:09,869
          that's good.

561
00:24:09,871 --> 00:24:12,905
  And when they send operate,
     we're gonna figure out

562
00:24:12,907 --> 00:24:15,808
 which one is sending it by the
  same exact way we did above.

563
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,543
    We're gonna say what is
  the sender's current title?

564
00:24:18,545 --> 00:24:20,111
     We're gonna unwrap it.

565
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:24,582
      So operation here is
       gonna be a string.

566
00:24:24,584 --> 00:24:28,418
   And it's going to tell us
  the title of the buttons so

567
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,721
       we know which one
         to use there.

568
00:24:31,723 --> 00:24:35,758
    Now I'm gonna show you a
 control flow operator here in

569
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,128
  Swift that's very powerful,
    much more powerful than

570
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,463
      this operator is in
        other languages.

571
00:24:41,465 --> 00:24:43,432
         And also very,
   very important to switch.

572
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:46,401
  I'm only gonna show you the
 simplest usage of it here, but

573
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:49,170
      you're gonna see on
   Monday's demonstration and

574
00:24:49,172 --> 00:24:51,906
    later in the quarter how
  important this operator is.

575
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,541
  But, it's switch, okay, and

576
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:59,846
    switch looks like switch
  in other languages, like C.

577
00:24:59,848 --> 00:25:01,080
    You switch on something.

578
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,015
     In this case I'm gonna
     switch on this string.

579
00:25:03,017 --> 00:25:04,483
      This is the string.

580
00:25:04,485 --> 00:25:06,852
     Then you just specify
    the case of each thing.

581
00:25:06,854 --> 00:25:10,822
             So for
  example here I have a case.

582
00:25:10,824 --> 00:25:17,561
     Let's do the multiply.

583
00:25:17,563 --> 00:25:21,031
       Okay, so we've got
   multiply case right here.

584
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:24,234
      And then we just put
   the code that we want here

585
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:26,203
         for multiply.

586
00:25:26,204 --> 00:25:28,171
      And we'd do that for
   all the other cases here.

587
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:30,439
    So let's copy and paste.

588
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:36,478
       And we'll do this
      be our divide case.

589
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,347
      And we'll have this
      be our plus case and

590
00:25:39,349 --> 00:25:41,215
    we'll have this be our,

591
00:25:41,217 --> 00:25:45,753
 make sure we're doing the same
  [INAUDIBLE] here, plus case.

592
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:49,689
    Again, you've got to be
     a little careful here.

593
00:25:49,691 --> 00:25:51,858
    You know, this minus is
  slightly different from this

594
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,593
 minus which might be slightly
    different than the minus

595
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:55,828
  you type with the keyboard.

596
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:59,164
    So, when you're putting
       the symbols here,

597
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:03,434
 you wanna use exactly the same
   symbols here in your case.

598
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,871
  Now, one thing about Switch
     on Swift though is it

599
00:26:06,873 --> 00:26:11,274
  absolutely requires that you
    have every case covered.

600
00:26:11,276 --> 00:26:13,877
  Now since this is a string,
  obviously can't have case of
    由于这是一个字符串,显然不可能

601
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:15,345
      every single string
        in the universe.
    穷举每一种情况
602
00:26:15,347 --> 00:26:18,280
    That is almost infinite,
       but luckily there,
    通常是无限多的,但是很幸运的是,
603
00:26:18,282 --> 00:26:22,584
   you can take defaults and
 just break out of the switch.
    可以再default后,使用break跳出switch
604
00:26:22,586 --> 00:26:26,187
 That means if it's not one of
  these cases by default just
    也就是如果不是上面列举的情况,
605
00:26:26,189 --> 00:26:27,088
    break out of the switch.
    就会默认跳出switch语句
606
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,355
       You could put code
         here as well,
    代码也可以放在这里
607
00:26:28,357 --> 00:26:31,091
   but breaking out of it is
 what we wanna do in our case.
    在需要的地方break
608
00:26:33,028 --> 00:26:35,861
 now, in here, we're just going
 to put the code for multiply.
    现在,在这里,放乘法相关的语句
609
00:26:35,863 --> 00:26:37,896
 So, what do we need to do for
           multiply?
    那么,乘法需要做些什么?
610
00:26:37,898 --> 00:26:40,432
        For the moment,
  I'm gonna comment this out.
    我会暂时将这部分注视掉
611
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,667
 I'm gonna use command, slash,
    使用command + / 来注释
612
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:44,502
       which is a really
         nice feature.
    这种注释方法的确称得上是一个很不错的功能.
613
00:26:44,504 --> 00:26:46,103
     You do command slash.
     command + /之后,
614
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,238
 And then command slash again,
         to uncomment.
    再次command + /来取消给代码注释.
615
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,311
  [INAUDIBLE] real quick cuz I
   just wanna focus on times.
    这样就可以专注于当前的事情上,
616
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:58,247
         Now any time I
      press any operator,
    任何时候,点击任何操作符,
617
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:02,317
     I probably wanna give
  the user an automatic enter.
    可能会给用户自动按下enter键
618
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:05,087
   That's so that six enter,
          three enter,
    也就是6,enter,3,enter
619
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:07,989
      times is the same as
     six enter three times.
    乘,和6乘以3一样
620
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:12,393
 Okay, so six enter three times
 is gonna do an automatic enter
    好了,6 enter 3 乘 会自动来一个enter
621
00:27:12,395 --> 00:27:13,927
         on that three.
		在那个3之上

622
00:27:14,996 --> 00:27:16,596
         Cuz obviously,
    I intend to have six and
 显然,在这种情况下,我想让6和
623
00:27:16,598 --> 00:27:18,998
      three be multiplied
         in that case.
		 3相乘
624
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,705
      So for all of these
  operations, I going to say,
	对于所有的操作符,我要说的是
625
00:27:26,707 --> 00:27:29,708
   if the users in the middle
      of typing a number.
	 如果用户在中间输入一个数字,

626
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,443
       Then hit enter for
        me, right here.
		然后点击enter键.

627
00:27:32,445 --> 00:27:36,347
     Okay, so [COUGH] what
      do we need to do in	
		好了,我们需要
628
00:27:36,349 --> 00:27:39,516
  this specific case of times?
  在乘这里做什么?
	

629
00:27:39,518 --> 00:27:42,886
   Well, really we just want
   to set our display value.
	我们需要在这里显示计算的结果.
630
00:27:42,888 --> 00:27:46,856
   Remember we have our nice
    display value down here.
	记住,我们有自己的显示值的方法.
631
00:27:46,858 --> 00:27:49,492
     And we can do setting
      as well as getting.
	我们可以进行赋值,也可以进行取值
632
00:27:49,494 --> 00:27:52,094
  So I set that display value.
	因此,在这里赋值.
633
00:27:52,096 --> 00:27:55,264
            Up here.
	 这里.
634
00:27:55,265 --> 00:27:58,433
  Equal to multiplying the top
   two things on this stack.
	等于将栈顶的两个数相乘
635
00:27:58,435 --> 00:28:02,270
    So I can actually remove
    something off our stack.
	因此,我可以从栈里移除一些元素.
636
00:28:02,272 --> 00:28:04,705
     We're representing our
       stack as an array.
	我们使用一个数组带代表栈结构.
637
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:07,908
           Of course,
 they are stacked as an array.
	当然了,确实是使用一个数组来表示的栈.
638
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,311
  And so a stack is something
      you push things on,
	栈是一个可以压入元素到栈离,
639
00:28:11,313 --> 00:28:12,979
      you pop things off.
	可以从栈里弹出元素
640
00:28:12,981 --> 00:28:15,614
 And with an array, we're just
  gonna add something there at
	使用数组的话,只要
641
00:28:15,616 --> 00:28:17,082
 the end to push something on,
              and
	在数组的末尾添加一个元素来模拟元素入栈
642
00:28:17,084 --> 00:28:19,317
    that will just remove it
  from the end to pop it off.
	在数组的末尾移除一个元素来模拟元素出栈
643
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:21,653
       So there's a nice.
	这种模拟看起来很酷吧.
644
00:28:21,655 --> 00:28:23,654
           All right.
    This is an array, right?
	好了,这是一个数组,是么?
645
00:28:23,656 --> 00:28:26,007
        Operand stacks.
	操作符栈.
646
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:28,359
     There's a nice method
      called remove last.
	有个很好使的方法叫做:移除最后一个元素
647
00:28:28,361 --> 00:28:30,894
   And if we option click on
  remove last, you'll see here
	如果在removelast方法上按住option键,
648
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:33,430
   that it removes an element
   from the end of the array.
	可以看到说明:从数组的末尾移除一个元素
649
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:37,567
      Now, it does require
   a count greater than zero.
	需要数组的元素个数大于零.
650
00:28:37,569 --> 00:28:42,705
   So if our array were empty
 this would crash our program.
	如果数组是空的话,移除元素会导致程序崩溃
651
00:28:42,707 --> 00:28:44,840
     So let's put a little
     protective thing here.
	所以,在这里做一些保护性的措施.
652
00:28:44,842 --> 00:28:47,742
     If the operand stacks.
	如果操作符栈
653
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,411
    There's a nice property
   here called Count on that.
	操作符栈变量有一个属性叫做Count
654	
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:52,947
        It is greater or
	如果大于或者
655
00:28:52,948 --> 00:28:55,482
 equal to two actually because
 multiply takes two operand so
	等于2,因为乘法需要2个操作数
656
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,484
        there better two
     things on this stack.
	所以至少需要栈中有2个元素
657
00:28:58,921 --> 00:29:01,121
   Then we can do this and so
	然后,我们可以这样做,
658
00:29:01,123 --> 00:29:05,324
   we're gonna multiply that
  by and remove the next one.
	相乘,然后移除最后一个元素
659
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,125
             Okay?
	对么?
660
00:29:06,127 --> 00:29:07,259
        So here we got-
	这样的话,
661
00:29:09,062 --> 00:29:12,463
 We're just taking the last two
  things off of this stack by
	我们从栈中移除最后两个元素,
662
00:29:12,465 --> 00:29:14,832
       removing them from
    the end of the array and
	通过从数组中移除元素
663
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:17,334
       just assigning it
       to display value.
	赋值给displayValue变量
664
00:29:17,336 --> 00:29:19,469
      And we probably also
   want to do an enter here,
	这里可能需要做一个enter,
665
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:22,539
    because [COUGH] if I go
     six enter three times,
	如果单击6 enter 3 乘,
666
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:25,108
  well then I want to be able
   to say then nine plus and
	这样就得到9加
667
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,744
        have it add onto
      the six times three.
	然后加上6乘以3
668
00:29:29,713 --> 00:29:32,213
    So we want an automatic
      enter here, as well.
	这里需要一个自动点击enter,
669
00:29:32,215 --> 00:29:34,149
             Okay?
	是么?
670
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,084
     So, that's pretty much
    all we need to do here.
	这大概就是我们需要在这里做的了.
671
00:29:36,086 --> 00:29:41,021
  Let's go ahead and run this,
      see how this works.
	继续,运行这个程序,看它是怎么工作的,
672
00:29:43,826 --> 00:29:47,527
     And so, six enter, or
    three enter, six enter.
	6 确认 或者 3 确认 6 确认
673
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:49,996
       Now we've got them
       both on the stack.
	可以在栈上看到它们
674
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:52,898
     Times and you can see
      we put our 18 here.
	相乘,然后可以看到结果是18
675
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,668
      It also put it back
        on the stack and
	结果也被放入的栈中,
676
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,536
     we can say five times.
	比如,5 乘
677
00:29:57,538 --> 00:29:59,237
        That put a five
        on the stack and
	将5放入栈中,
678
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:01,372
     then multiplied them,
          took it off.
	将它们相乘,从栈中移除,
679
00:30:01,374 --> 00:30:03,107
   So that's working nicely.
	程序运行的不错啊
680
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:05,576
  [COUGH] Now what about our-
	现在,
681
00:30:05,578 --> 00:30:06,743
      Other buttons, here.
	这里,我们的其他的按钮,
682
00:30:06,745 --> 00:30:08,745
   We gonna make those work.
	我们要让它们工作.
683
00:30:08,747 --> 00:30:12,548
         Let's do that.
	让我们完成这个工作.
684
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:16,152
      Now, they do a very
      similar thing, here.
	它们需要完成十分相似的事情, 
685
00:30:16,154 --> 00:30:20,088
    So, one temptation would
     be to just copy here.
	所以,来复制下这部分,
686
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,657
   Let's uncomment these out.
	打开这部分的注释,
687
00:30:23,693 --> 00:30:25,459
    And then just paste it,
          repeatedly.
	然后粘贴到这里,重复粘贴,
688
00:30:25,461 --> 00:30:26,827
       So, put it there.
	放到这里.
689
00:30:27,996 --> 00:30:31,831
   There, there and then just
     changes times in here.
	只需要更改这里的乘号.
690
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:35,868
       D note to plus for
      example on this one.
	这个换成一个加号,
691
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:39,038
 But his is pretty messy code,
        look at all this
	但是,这样的代码看起来很乱,
692
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,841
      incredible amount of
   duplicating code, in here.
	这里有大量的重复的代码,
693
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:47,145
  We really probably wouldn't
  to write our code like this.
	我们确实不希望我们的代码写成这样.
694
00:30:47,147 --> 00:30:49,780
   People would think we were
     terrible programmers I
	别人会认为我们是很糟糕的程序员
695
00:30:49,782 --> 00:30:51,482
     think if we did that.
	如果我们像这样写代码的话.
696
00:30:51,484 --> 00:30:54,251
      Really what would be
    nice is if we had some,
	什么样的代码看起来会不错呢? 
697
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:56,453
        could write some
       kind of function.
	那就是如果我们可以把这些重复的代码写成函数
698
00:30:56,455 --> 00:31:00,990
     Maybe we could call it
      perform operation or
	我们可能会给这个函数起名perfomOperation
699
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:02,458
      something like that.
	或者类似意思的名字.
700
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,927
      And if the argument
       to that function.
	至于函数的参数,
701
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:08,196
         Remember that
     arguments have names.
	注意,函数参数也是又名字的,
702
00:31:08,198 --> 00:31:09,163
        Here's the name.
	这就是名字. 
703
00:31:09,165 --> 00:31:10,364
   And then we have the type.
	然后是参数类型. 
704
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:16,269
  The argument were something
    which basically was this
	这里的参数就是
705
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:19,305
  little operation in here, or
	这里的操作符,
706
00:31:19,307 --> 00:31:21,707
   some sort of function that
    would do this operation.
	这就是完成操作符操作的函数.
707
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:24,576
    So if this could be some
     sort of function that
 	如果可以写成函数的话,
708
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:25,277
         would be cool.
	看起来就不错了.
709
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,078
     Then, maybe we could.
	然后,我们可能会,
710
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,880
 I take this code out of here,
        put it in here.
	将这段代码移动到这里,
711
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:34,384
   Let's call it perform not
  pre-form, perform operation.
	起码为perform,而不是pre-form
712
00:31:34,386 --> 00:31:36,353
   [LAUGH] Put it in here and
	放在这里.
713
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:38,921
       instead of doing,
    you know, multiply here.
	你懂的,这里不是使用乘.
714
00:31:38,923 --> 00:31:41,190
   Let's go ahead and we can
  do this operation some how.
	继续,完成这个操作.
715
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:42,891
 I guess, well maybe operation,
	可能是operation函数,
716
00:31:42,893 --> 00:31:48,196
    call it like a function
    with two arguments here.
	像一个带两个参数的函数一样调用.
717
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:52,500
             Okay.
         That would be
	好了,看起来很不错了.
718
00:31:52,502 --> 00:31:55,202
 cool because we'd be sharing,
     you know, this check.
	因为我们共用了这段代码.
719
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,204
  We'd be sharing this enter.
	公用了这enter方法
720
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,472
    [COUGH] We'd be sharing
  the removal of the operator.
	共用了removal操作方法.
721
00:31:59,474 --> 00:32:01,441
        We'd be sharing
    the same display value.
	共用了displayValue变量. 
722
00:32:01,443 --> 00:32:04,209
    We'd be kind of sharing
     a lot of code here and
	这样,公用了大段的代码,
723
00:32:05,746 --> 00:32:08,179
    then up here if we could
    just do something like,
	在上面,只需要像这样做,
724
00:32:08,181 --> 00:32:12,850
       perform operation,
     and, somehow, specify,
	调用函数,
725
00:32:12,852 --> 00:32:16,186
   multiply, as the operation
     we wanted to do here.
	指定函数参数,
726
00:32:16,188 --> 00:32:23,593
   And then we wouldn't need
  all this stuff here, right?
	这段代码就不需要了,对么?
727
00:32:23,595 --> 00:32:24,527
   So this is gonna be cool.
	看起来很不错吧?
728
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:25,995
      Now, can we do this?
	可以这样做么?
729
00:32:25,997 --> 00:32:28,564
           Well, yes,
     the answer is we can.
	当然了,可以的.
730
00:32:28,566 --> 00:32:33,134
   And so, types, functions.
	参数类型,函数
731
00:32:33,136 --> 00:32:37,005
     Can be types in Swift,
   just like any other type.
	在Swift里可以当做类型,就像其他的类型一样
732
00:32:37,007 --> 00:32:40,040
     So, you know, we have
  a double here, oops, double.
	这里需要一个double,
733
00:32:41,844 --> 00:32:42,809
         That's a type.
	就是这个类型,
734
00:32:42,811 --> 00:32:43,943
       You can also have
        a function type.
	也可以有一个函数类型.
735
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:45,611
     So how do you specify
        a function type?
	那么,怎么指定一个函数类型呢?
736
00:32:45,613 --> 00:32:47,846
       Well multiple I or
	比如multiple,
737
00:32:47,848 --> 00:32:49,981
     whatever function I'm
     about to perform here.
	或者是任何其他想要执行的函数,
738
00:32:49,983 --> 00:32:54,686
 This is a function that takes
   two doubles as arguments.
	这个函数需要两个double类型的参数
739
00:32:54,688 --> 00:32:56,354
    And it returns a double.
	函数的返回值类型也是一个double类型
740
00:32:56,356 --> 00:33:00,190
      So, I can just say,
     I want operation to be
	我想要一个函数,
741
00:33:00,192 --> 00:33:04,661
   a function that takes two
 doubles and returns a double.
	带两个double类型参数,返回double类型
742
00:33:04,663 --> 00:33:07,363
 I can express that right here.
	这就是我要表达的,
743
00:33:07,365 --> 00:33:11,300
        This is a type,
       the type of this.
	这就是参数类型,这种类型.
744
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:15,870
  Argument right here that you
   can click on and say yeah
	在这里的参数上右键,
745
00:33:15,872 --> 00:33:18,639
 that type is double takes two
 doubles and returns a double.
	可以看到信息:2个double类型的参数,一个double类型返回值.
746
00:33:20,276 --> 00:33:22,176
    So, just simple as that.
	就是这么简单.
747
00:33:22,177 --> 00:33:24,077
       So all we need now
       is a function here
	我们所知道的,这里是一个函数,
748
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:26,379
      called multiply that
     takes two doubles and
	函数名multiply,带2个参数,
749
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,514
      returns a double and
      does multiplication.
	返回double类型,完成乘法操作.
750
00:33:28,516 --> 00:33:33,118
  So we could go down here and
     say okay multiply and
	好了,看下面的乘,
751
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,587
     you'll have op1 which
       is double and op2.
	有一个参数,double类型,第二个参数, 
752
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:39,157
      [COUGH] A double and
    it returned the double.
	double类型,返回一个double类型.
753
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:41,926
      And it's just return
       one times out two.
	这个函数返回参数1乘以参数2
754
00:33:42,962 --> 00:33:44,261
             Okay?
	对么?
755
00:33:44,263 --> 00:33:45,729
     And that worked great.
	看来起不错哟!
756
00:33:45,731 --> 00:33:51,600
    Back out again so we can
  see if this actually works.
	回到上面,看它是否真的可以正常运行.
757
00:33:51,602 --> 00:33:53,168
  But there's no arrows here.
	没有任何错误.
758
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,387
             Right?
       It seems to work.
	对么?看起来可行.
759
00:33:55,388 --> 00:33:57,605
      Multiply seems to be
 a function to take the $2 and

760
00:33:57,608 --> 00:33:59,274
        turns it double.

761
00:33:59,275 --> 00:34:00,941
      And that's what this
      argument here is and
	这里的这个参数,
762
00:34:00,944 --> 00:34:02,661
     I'm passing it along.
	将它传入
763
00:34:02,662 --> 00:34:04,379
     It should all work so
      let's give it a try.
	应该是可行的,那么试一下吧.
764
00:34:08,818 --> 00:34:10,684
        So here we go as
        it takes enter.
	  点下enter
765
00:34:10,686 --> 00:34:15,188
          54 times and
  sure enough it's working it.
	54乘以,好了,没问题.
766
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,757
        It's doing that
        multiplication.
	完成了乘法操作.
767
00:34:18,826 --> 00:34:23,428
 Works great and so what about
  all of our other cases here?
	做的不错,其他的case语句呢?
768
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:26,731
       Well we would just
    need to take this same.
	只需要也像这样做.
769
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:29,400
  Piece of code right here and
    put it for all of them.
	所有的case语句,这里一段代码,
770
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:32,169
 And of course we need a divide
     method, so we have to
	当然了,我们需要除法函数,
771
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:35,805
  come down here, and copy and
  paste that, and make divide.
	来到下面,复制,粘贴,起名divide
772
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,907
       Oh wait a second,
	稍等, 
773
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,210
  this is starting to be just
    as bad as I had before.
	看起来又像之前的一样,很糟糕了.
774
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,646
    Having to make all these
 extra functions, multiply and
	需要这些额外的函数,乘法,
775
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:46,081
      divide and all that.
	触发,等等.
776
00:34:46,082 --> 00:34:47,515
        Well [COUGH] it
       turns out it's so
	事情上,
777
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:52,553
  common to pass functions as
  arguments in Swift, that it
	字啊Swift中,把函数作为参数传递是很常见的.
778
00:34:52,555 --> 00:34:56,390
  allows you to put a function
     like multiply right in
	允许你传递一个,比如multiply,的函数,
779
00:34:56,392 --> 00:35:00,327
 here without having to create
 a separate function like this.
	不需要再创建一个函数
780
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:02,195
       And all you do is
      you just pick it up.
	需要做的是,选中,
781
00:35:02,197 --> 00:35:05,131
    So I'm just going to cut
    that from down here and
	从这里剪切
782
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:06,599
       I'm going to paste
       it right in here.
	粘贴到这里来
783
00:35:07,702 --> 00:35:10,168
   The only thing you have to
 change syntactically when you
	唯一需要做语法上的改变的是,
784
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:13,738
  do that is this curly brace,
             okay.
	这里是一个大括号.
785
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,541
     Instead of being after
       the declaration of
	而不是之前在声明
786
00:35:16,543 --> 00:35:21,779
  the arguments in the return
 value, it needs to be before.
	函数,返回值之后.
787
00:35:21,781 --> 00:35:24,314
     So, you move the curly
         brace before.
	把大括号放到前面.	
788
00:35:24,316 --> 00:35:25,648
         And then where
      the curly brace was,
	之前这里是小括号.
789
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,417
 you gonna put in, the word in.
	这里添加一个单词in
790
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:30,486
 And so that allows us to just.
	允许我们稍微调整下.
791
00:35:30,488 --> 00:35:34,723
   Come and do that again to
 eliminate some of our errors.
	现在把这些错误解决了,
792
00:35:34,725 --> 00:35:37,291
     And we can get rid of
  function multiply down here.
	移除这里的mutiply
793
00:35:39,328 --> 00:35:42,862
 So that allows me to just put
 that multiplier right in here.
	把乘法放在这里.
794
00:35:42,864 --> 00:35:44,030
         Right in line.
	就是这里.
795
00:35:44,032 --> 00:35:46,032
     Write as the argument
       to this function.
	给这个函数写一个参数.
796
00:35:46,034 --> 00:35:48,167
 And this things kind of wacky.
	 看起来略古怪.
797
00:35:48,169 --> 00:35:49,701
        For those of you
       who don't know it,
	对于一些不了解的人来讲,
798
00:35:49,703 --> 00:35:51,469
   user programming languages
      that allow this kind
 	编程语言中,
799
00:35:51,471 --> 00:35:53,604
       of thing to happen
      are called closures.
	这种情况称之为闭包.
800
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:56,540
 It basically allows you to put
   a function right in there.
	允许在这里放一个函数.
801
00:35:56,542 --> 00:36:02,812
   And this, okay here, looks
 okay, I mean we can certainly
	好了,这看起来还不错.
802
00:36:02,814 --> 00:36:05,481
 you know, now we can copy and
  paste this and put it here.
	下面又是复制,粘贴,放着
803
00:36:05,483 --> 00:36:06,615
       You know, here and
	放这里
804
00:36:06,617 --> 00:36:09,118
        change this and
  put it here and change this.
	改了这个,放在这里,改了这个,	
805
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,287
       But it can even be
       better than this.
	但是,我们可以进一步改进.
806
00:36:12,289 --> 00:36:15,223
     So we know that Swift
       is really good at
	我们知道Swift很擅长的
807
00:36:15,225 --> 00:36:17,658
        something called
        type inference.
	一个特性称为类型引用.
808
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,493
       Where I can kinda
      figure out the type,
 	从类型引用可以看出是什么类型,
809
00:36:19,495 --> 00:36:22,863
         of something,
       from the context.
	结合上下文来看.
810
00:36:22,865 --> 00:36:25,165
         And you can do
      the same thing here.
	这里也可以这么做.
811
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:27,267
      Because its looking
     at perform operation.
	看下这里的performOperation
812
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,435
    It knows you're calling
       perform operation.
	它知道你在调用performOperation
813
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:33,039
   It knows this argument is
   a function that takes two
	它知道这个函数的参数,
814
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,940
 doubles and returns a double.
	2个double类型,一个double类型的返回值.
815
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:38,377
  So you really don't have to
 specify all the types in here.
	所以,这里不需要明确的指定类型,
816
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:39,978
   Cuz it knows all of this.
	因为它知道这些事情.
817
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,381
 So you can actually get rid of
  all these type decorations,
	所以,可以删除这些类型声明.
818
00:36:43,383 --> 00:36:45,416
  right here, even the return.
	甚至是返回值类型也可以省去.
819
00:36:45,418 --> 00:36:47,851
          And, again,
 seeing no warnings, no errors.
	可以看到,没有任何警告,错误.
820
00:36:47,853 --> 00:36:49,553
     It knows that this has
      to be a double, and
	它知道这个参数是double,
821
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:51,454
    this has to be a double.
	这个参数也是dobule类型.
822
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:53,556
    Because it knows you're
   calling perform operation.
	因为它知道你需要调用的函数.
823
00:36:53,558 --> 00:36:56,959
    So it knows the argument
     to that is like that.
	就像这样,它知道函数的参数.
824
00:36:58,529 --> 00:37:00,962
  Okay, and you can even make
   this look a little nicer.
	好了,可以进行进一步的改进.
825
00:37:00,964 --> 00:37:03,631
      We can move this all
       up onto one line.
	把这些上移一行.
826
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,168
        Really nice for
       readability here.
	看来起更具有可读性.
827
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:11,037
    But, we can actually do
     even better than this,
	事实上,我们可以做的更好. 
828
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:15,074
    because Swift knows that
  perform operations argument
	因为Swift知道这个函数
829
00:37:15,076 --> 00:37:18,844
  returns something, you don't
  need this return key if your
	返回一个值,所以你不需要return
830
00:37:18,846 --> 00:37:22,715
  whole is just an expression
   like this return key word.
	如果所有的代码只有一个返回语句.
831
00:37:22,717 --> 00:37:25,717
  You don;t need that key word
    because it knows this is
	不需要return这个关键字了,
832
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,485
  going to return something so
	因为程序知道你要返回什么.
833
00:37:27,487 --> 00:37:32,056
   this is just an expression
    it's going to return it.
	这样只返回一个表达式就可以了.
834
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:37,260
   But it's even better than
   that because a swift does
	更好的做法是,
835
00:37:37,262 --> 00:37:40,597
     not force you to name
      these two arguments.
	swift不强制你给这两个参数命名.
836
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:44,967
   If you don;t name them it
    will use the names Dar0.
	如果不手动命名的话,程序自动给参数起码$0
837
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:46,952
         Dollar 1, and
	$1,
838
00:37:46,953 --> 00:37:48,936
  if you have more arguments,
 dollar 2, dollar 3, dollar 4.
	如果有更多的参数,会命名为$2,$3,$4.
839
00:37:48,939 --> 00:37:50,706
  So you don't even need this.
	所以,这也不要了.
840
00:37:52,142 --> 00:37:53,441
             Okay?
	对么?
841
00:37:53,443 --> 00:37:55,710
     So this is a function
          right here.
	这里是一个函数.
842
00:37:55,712 --> 00:37:58,112
     It takes two doubles,
   dollar 0 and dollar 1, and
	这个函数有两个double类型参数,$0,$1	
843
00:37:58,114 --> 00:37:59,546
       returns a double.
	返回一个double类型的值.
844
00:37:59,548 --> 00:38:02,916
  Now Swift knows that they're
 doubles because it knows that
	Swift知道它们是double类型.
845
00:38:02,918 --> 00:38:04,517
     you're passing them to
     perform an operation.
	因为你将它们传递给了这个函数.
846
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:07,920
  If you were passing this to
  some other, a function that
	如果把它们传递给其他的函数,
847
00:38:07,922 --> 00:38:10,789
     took different kind of
 function as an argument, then,
	比如有不同类型的参数,
848
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:14,126
 you know, these types might be
 different but in this case it
	这些类型可能和上面不同.
849
00:38:14,128 --> 00:38:16,961
  knows that's what it is and
 it knows that it returns once
	但是Swift知道该使用什么类型
850
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:20,731
 it knows it's going to return
   what this calculation is.
	这里就是这样的.
851
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:22,366
           All right.
	好了.
852
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:26,536
  Now one more cool syntactic
   thing you can do is if you
	更酷的事情是,
853
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:29,305
      have a function like
     performOperation, and
	如果有一个performOperation这样的函数,
854
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,741
 it has an argument which is a
 function like operation here,
	有个像operation这样的参数,
855
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:36,445
      if this argument is
  the last argument, okay, so
	如果是最后一个参数,
856
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,446
    if I had other arguments
         before it, and
	在之前又别的参数,
857
00:38:38,448 --> 00:38:42,917
  this was the argument, then
   you can move the function.
	这是参数,可以移动这个函数的位置
858
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:47,888
    Outside the parentheses,
      so other arguments,
	移动到括号外,参数也是.
859
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,123
 if there were other arguments
 before, they would go in here.
	如果又其他类型的参数,可以放在这里. 
860
00:38:51,726 --> 00:38:54,327
    But this last argument,
	但是这个最后的一个参数.
861
00:38:54,328 --> 00:38:56,929
 which is this operation, gets
 to go outside the parentheses.
	这个函数,需要放在括号外.
862
00:38:56,931 --> 00:38:59,564
   And if there are no other
     arguments, if this is
	如果没有其他的参数,
863
00:38:59,566 --> 00:39:02,033
   the only argument, you can
   actually get rid of that.
	如果只有一个参数,可以删除它.
864
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,269
             Okay.
	好了.
865
00:39:05,271 --> 00:39:08,705
     So, we're cutting down
     to incredibly concise
	 因此,我们把程序变得很简洁了	
866
00:39:08,707 --> 00:39:13,509
    language here and we can
    do this exact same deal,
	可以再这样做.
867
00:39:13,511 --> 00:39:18,047
      of course with these
     other form operations.
	其他的操作也可以这样做.
868
00:39:18,049 --> 00:39:19,848
  We just need to change the.
	只需要改这里.
869
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:21,382
         Nothing here.
	这里不需要改.
870	
00:39:22,585 --> 00:39:24,184
    This one, we be a little
   careful with the order of
	这里,需要注意参数的顺序,
871
00:39:24,186 --> 00:39:27,421
        operations here,
  we wanna do this because we
	我们会这么做,
872
00:39:27,423 --> 00:39:30,824
   click the thing that we're
 dividing by on the stack last.
	除以栈中的最后一个元素.
873
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:34,660
   And that's the first thing
   that comes off the stack.
	栈中最先离开的元素
874
00:39:34,662 --> 00:39:35,494
 And same thing here actually,
	这里也要注意,
875
00:39:35,496 --> 00:39:38,163
        the subtraction
       minus dollar here.
	减法,减号,$,	
876
00:39:38,165 --> 00:39:41,900
     Okay, so, this is our
      entire operate, and
	好了,这就是我们的全部操作.
877
00:39:41,902 --> 00:39:44,469
     you can see that it's
      incredibly concise.
	你可以看到,这相当的简洁.
878
00:39:44,471 --> 00:39:45,803
         Very readable.
	很高的可读性.
879
00:39:45,805 --> 00:39:47,504
        TImes is clearly
      doing this function.
	这里改成乘法. 
880
00:39:47,506 --> 00:39:48,905
      And very extensible.
	也有很高的可扩展性
881
00:39:48,907 --> 00:39:50,206
        If you wanna add
        more functions,
	如果需要添加更多的操作,
882
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:51,974
    we just one liners here,
	只需要这里添加一行代码.
883
00:39:51,976 --> 00:39:55,745
 but more these [COUGH] binary
  functions that have two So,
	这里我们就只有这么多.
884
00:39:55,747 --> 00:39:58,814
    let's go ahead and make
  sure these are all working.
	继续,确保我们程序运行问题.
885
00:40:02,753 --> 00:40:04,686
           All right.
	好的.
886
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:06,620
      So, 6 enter 5 times,
    that's 30, that's good.
	6乘以5,结果是30,看起来不错.
887
00:40:06,623 --> 00:40:11,291
     How about 47 plus 77,
           excellent.
	47加上77,不错.
888
00:40:11,293 --> 00:40:13,593
      How about 2 divide.
	2除以
889
00:40:13,595 --> 00:40:14,928
             38.5.
	     38.5
890
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:17,397
   [INAUDIBLE] number there.
	这个数,三十八点五.
891
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:20,299
 Working, you can see the stack
  doing all the right things.
	正常,可以看到做的还错.
892
00:40:21,368 --> 00:40:24,102
             Okay?
          Make sense?
	对么?正确的吧?
893
00:40:24,104 --> 00:40:26,771
      Now, I'm going to do
     one more thing, here.
	现在,还需要做一个事情.
894
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,473
        Which is to add
       another operation,
	就是添加另外的一个操作符.
895
00:40:29,475 --> 00:40:31,174
 this is going to be a slightly
      different operation.
	稍有不同的一个操作.
896
00:40:31,176 --> 00:40:32,375
   So, I'm going to copy and
	复制一下,
897
00:40:32,377 --> 00:40:35,144
     paste these operation
         buttons here.
	粘贴到这里.
898
00:40:35,146 --> 00:40:37,880
 Again, I'm going to make sure
    they are lined up really
	确保真正的对齐了.
899
00:40:37,882 --> 00:40:41,350
   nice with as many of these
    blue lines as I can get.
	使用蓝色的线来对齐.	
900
00:40:42,786 --> 00:40:44,919
     I'm actually going to
   leave these buttons here.
	把按钮放在这.
901
00:40:46,255 --> 00:40:48,389
  Because you're going to need
    them for your homework.

902
00:40:48,391 --> 00:40:50,323
    But we gonna change this
  button right down here to be

903
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:51,825
     a different operator.

904
00:40:52,894 --> 00:40:54,760
     Which is going to be,
          square root.

905
00:40:54,762 --> 00:40:57,629
      Which is right here,
     square root operator.

906
00:40:58,732 --> 00:40:59,297
           All right?

907
00:40:59,299 --> 00:41:05,803
 And, so, I'm going to go back
   her to do square root, and

908
00:41:05,805 --> 00:41:07,704
 it's just another case, right.

909
00:41:07,706 --> 00:41:08,805
       Case square root.

910
00:41:09,841 --> 00:41:12,808
    And, maybe I should just
    be able to use the same

911
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,709
       mechanism, right?

912
00:41:13,711 --> 00:41:14,843
    Let's see if that works.

913
00:41:15,946 --> 00:41:18,897
      Place that in there.

914
00:41:18,898 --> 00:41:21,849
  And instead of this bracket
  here, let's use the built in

915
00:41:21,851 --> 00:41:25,285
    function in Swift to do
    square root called sqrt.

916
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:26,219
      And a dollar there.

917
00:41:26,221 --> 00:41:27,187
          Looks good.

918
00:41:27,189 --> 00:41:29,322
  And then we're ready to go.

919
00:41:29,324 --> 00:41:32,591
   Let's just work, call it,
     what's going on here.

920
00:41:32,593 --> 00:41:35,794
 They have some sort of error,
      what's the problem.

921
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:36,995
      I don't understand.

922
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:38,163
   Let's take a look at this.

923
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:42,867
   Now this error is a little
     hard to understand but

924
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:46,970
   basically what it's saying
     is that you're calling

925
00:41:46,972 --> 00:41:51,207
 performOperation here with an
 argument which is a function,

926
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:54,177
   it only takes on argument.

927
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,378
   Goes Swift looks here and

928
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,579
    it's used that it's only
     using a dollar zero so

929
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:00,849
     this is a one argument
      function this whole

930
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,785
     curly brace thing is a
 function that is one argument.

931
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:07,121
      Well four operation
     takes a function that

932
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:08,189
       has two arguments.

933
00:42:09,692 --> 00:42:11,591
      So that's a mismatch
       that doesn't work.

934
00:42:12,594 --> 00:42:14,694
    So how can we fix this.

935
00:42:14,695 --> 00:42:16,795
  Well actually believe it or
 not we can just make a copy of

936
00:42:16,798 --> 00:42:19,398
   form operation of another
       method, same name.

937
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,067
     This one we are gonna
   have different arguments.

938
00:42:22,069 --> 00:42:24,736
       It's gonna have a,
      an argument which is

939
00:42:24,738 --> 00:42:27,605
 a function that only takes one
  double and returns a double.

940
00:42:28,574 --> 00:42:30,224
     And then inside here,

941
00:42:30,225 --> 00:42:31,875
   obviously we don't need to
 pull two things off the stack,

942
00:42:31,877 --> 00:42:32,609
           just one.

943
00:42:32,611 --> 00:42:35,645
 And obviously we only need to

944
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,413
    check to make sure there
   is one thing on the stack.

945
00:42:37,415 --> 00:42:41,950
           And look,
 all error warnings gone, okay?

946
00:42:41,952 --> 00:42:44,319
      So it automatically
     figured out that this

947
00:42:44,321 --> 00:42:46,321
      performer operation
       must be this one,

948
00:42:46,323 --> 00:42:49,857
   because this is a function
  that only has one argument.

949
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:52,460
    And so it matched it up
    with this version of it.

950
00:42:52,462 --> 00:42:55,996
   So in Swift, you can have
 functions with the same name.

951
00:42:55,998 --> 00:42:58,265
      As long as they have
      different arguments.

952
00:42:58,267 --> 00:42:59,399
      And that Swift will

953
00:42:59,401 --> 00:43:02,168
       automatically pick
   the right one, if it can.

954
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:03,936
      There are sometimes
      when it's just like,

955
00:43:03,938 --> 00:43:05,971
      I can't really tell
      which one you mean.

956
00:43:05,973 --> 00:43:08,673
     And it will certainly
    complain, in that case.

957
00:43:11,378 --> 00:43:14,311
   But most of the type it's
  gonna be on [INAUDIBLE] from

958
00:43:14,313 --> 00:43:16,647
      the types involved,
        what's going on.

959
00:43:16,649 --> 00:43:18,582
    So, just gonna run this
     one again real quick.

960
00:43:18,584 --> 00:43:22,852
  [INAUDIBLE] 36 square root.

961
00:43:22,854 --> 00:43:27,423
    Looks like it's working,
      9 times square root.

962
00:43:27,425 --> 00:43:27,989
           Excellent.

963
00:43:29,726 --> 00:43:30,291
             Okay.

964
00:43:31,627 --> 00:43:33,894
           All right.
              So,

965
00:43:33,895 --> 00:43:36,162
    the last thing I'm going
     to do here is work on

966
00:43:36,165 --> 00:43:37,431
  the layout of these buttons.

967
00:43:37,433 --> 00:43:38,531
 So that's all I'm gonna do for
           the code.

968
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,333
      You can see that we
     really didn't have to

969
00:43:40,335 --> 00:43:41,367
     write that much code.

970
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:45,003
     To make this work and

971
00:43:45,005 --> 00:43:47,939
     we got to do a lot of
     stuff in our UI here.

972
00:43:47,941 --> 00:43:50,708
 So, let's go ahead and make it
  so these buttons spread out.

973
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:54,778
 Cuz right now you see all this
  space is wasted right here.

974
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,481
        And on an iPhone
       in portrait mode.

975
00:43:57,483 --> 00:43:59,549
 Whole bottom space is wasted.

976
00:43:59,551 --> 00:44:01,484
        And an iPhone on
        landscape mode,

977
00:44:01,486 --> 00:44:02,685
 this whole size can be wasted.

978
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,920
     So I really want these
    buttons much bigger, and

979
00:44:04,922 --> 00:44:05,687
        stretching out.

980
00:44:07,124 --> 00:44:09,791
   Now, when you do something
  like that, you have to think

981
00:44:09,793 --> 00:44:12,226
  a little bit of kind of what
   your strategy is gonna be.

982
00:44:12,228 --> 00:44:15,696
   You can't just kinda root
     four start, you know,

983
00:44:15,698 --> 00:44:17,597
        control drag it
        between things.

984
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,667
      And trying to set up
    the horizontal spacing,

985
00:44:20,669 --> 00:44:24,437
  and maybe line up the, make
  the equal width and height.

986
00:44:24,439 --> 00:44:27,106
  Oh my gosh, you'd be control
     dragging all day long,

987
00:44:27,108 --> 00:44:28,374
         by doing that.

988
00:44:28,376 --> 00:44:30,475
    So I'm not going to use
    control drag to do this.

989
00:44:30,477 --> 00:44:33,945
 I'm going to use these buttons
  down here which will kind of

990
00:44:33,947 --> 00:44:36,414
   bulk out a layout buttons.

991
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:40,451
       Let's go ahead and
   use the whole screen here.

992
00:44:40,453 --> 00:44:43,620
       Document outline.

993
00:44:43,622 --> 00:44:45,939
        So what is going
       to be my strategy?

994
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,257
 Well, my strategy is I'm going
  to make a perfect grid here.

995
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:52,195
 So, I almost have one, except
 for there's one missing here.

996
00:44:52,197 --> 00:44:54,897
 So I'm actually going to take
  a button, copy and paste it.

997
00:44:54,899 --> 00:44:59,167
     Okay, just kind of be
 a dummy button here actually.

998
00:44:59,169 --> 00:45:00,969
         With no title.

999
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,770
 I'm going to right click on it
  also because I don't want it

1000
00:45:02,773 --> 00:45:04,939
      sending appendage or
       anything else, So

1001
00:45:04,941 --> 00:45:06,841
        its not going to
       send any messages.

1002
00:45:06,843 --> 00:45:09,309
     But it's just a dummy,
     so I'm kind of using.

1003
00:45:09,311 --> 00:45:12,245
     A little bit of brains
     over brawn here to do

1004
00:45:12,247 --> 00:45:13,680
       this perfect grid.

1005
00:45:13,682 --> 00:45:16,916
   Now if I have this perfect
   grid, then if I had a rule

1006
00:45:16,918 --> 00:45:20,720
 where all these buttons had to
 be the same size, and they all

1007
00:45:20,722 --> 00:45:24,857
  had the same spacing between
   their neighbors, not just.

1008
00:45:24,859 --> 00:45:28,160
   Between each other but the
 same spacing to this edge and

1009
00:45:28,162 --> 00:45:30,929
        the same spacing
       to this top edge.

1010
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:33,631
   Okay, if I had a rule like
    that then they would get

1011
00:45:33,633 --> 00:45:36,434
 big and of course the spacing
    is facing from this edge

1012
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:38,035
          to edge and
    this edge to this edge.

1013
00:45:38,037 --> 00:45:41,304
 If it was all the exactly the
  same, which I'll make it be

1014
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:44,708
 whatever this is, whatever the
  dash for the lines gave me.

1015
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:47,443
 If that was the same then they
 would all have to spread out.

1016
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:50,179
  Okay, they'd get bigger but

1017
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,880
    they'd all stay the same
   size because I'm going to

1018
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:54,516
     make a rule that they
   have to be the same size.

1019
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,317
      But they would move
      out to this edge so

1020
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:00,121
   that this nearest neighbor
  would be the same, you know,

1021
00:46:00,123 --> 00:46:02,322
     this distance would be
   the same as this distance.

1022
00:46:02,324 --> 00:46:05,092
     So that's my strategy,
  I'm going to try to do that.

1023
00:46:05,094 --> 00:46:06,760
     Now to make that work,

1024
00:46:06,762 --> 00:46:09,128
 all these buttons need to know
 who their nearest neighbor is.

1025
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:11,564
   Well, these all know their
     nearest neighbor here,

1026
00:46:11,566 --> 00:46:13,999
   the other buttons, because
   I made sure I used dashed,

1027
00:46:14,001 --> 00:46:17,035
       blue lines when I
     dragged them in there.

1028
00:46:17,037 --> 00:46:18,303
    So, that's what kind of

1029
00:46:18,305 --> 00:46:19,904
       teaches them their
       nearest neighbor.

1030
00:46:19,906 --> 00:46:22,573
   And I'm also going to make
   sure that the entire grid

1031
00:46:22,575 --> 00:46:25,442
  knows that the left edge and

1032
00:46:25,444 --> 00:46:29,046
  just under the label there,
     our nearest neighbor.

1033
00:46:29,048 --> 00:46:30,447
  So now it knows on the top,

1034
00:46:30,449 --> 00:46:32,348
      the nearest neighbor
       is the label, and

1035
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:34,383
   on the left is this edge.

1036
00:46:34,385 --> 00:46:37,386
       And it's going to
       pick this edge as

1037
00:46:37,388 --> 00:46:39,888
 the nearest neighbor for these
  buttons and the bottom edge,

1038
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:41,356
  cuz that's all there is and

1039
00:46:41,357 --> 00:46:42,823
     nothing else out here
      that's gonna become,

1040
00:46:42,826 --> 00:46:45,326
 that's the only neighbor there
   is, it's gonna pick those.

1041
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,962
        So now that I've
        used my dash for

1042
00:46:48,964 --> 00:46:51,898
       the lines it makes
      this all quite easy.

1043
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,866
     Now, if you don't use
   the dash for the lines, or

1044
00:46:53,868 --> 00:46:56,602
   if you make some mistakes
  then it's not going to work.

1045
00:46:56,604 --> 00:47:00,305
  This strategy won't work and
  I've made doing this part of

1046
00:47:00,307 --> 00:47:03,809
       this demonstration
        be extra credit.

1047
00:47:03,811 --> 00:47:06,044
  And so if you can't get it,
 don't worry about it too much,

1048
00:47:06,046 --> 00:47:09,247
 just keep all your buttons in
   the upper left corner here

1049
00:47:09,249 --> 00:47:11,199
        and that's fine.

1050
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,150
    But if you want to give
   this a try, the key is to

1051
00:47:13,152 --> 00:47:15,753
     use the dash lines to
     make the perfect grid.

1052
00:47:15,755 --> 00:47:18,822
     Make sure that you set
 the nearest neighbors here by

1053
00:47:18,824 --> 00:47:22,225
   dragging the whole grid to
   make blue lines appear on

1054
00:47:22,227 --> 00:47:23,793
           the sides.

1055
00:47:23,795 --> 00:47:26,962
   And then, we are going to
  set these rules in bulk and

1056
00:47:26,964 --> 00:47:29,965
     we do that with these
       buttons down here.

1057
00:47:29,966 --> 00:47:32,967
  So there's this button right
 here the left most button and

1058
00:47:32,969 --> 00:47:36,337
  it let's you set things like
   lining up leading edges or

1059
00:47:36,339 --> 00:47:37,872
    the tops or the centers.

1060
00:47:37,874 --> 00:47:40,174
  And you could imagine there
  might be a way to do this by

1061
00:47:40,176 --> 00:47:42,542
    doing that but I am not
  going to use that strategy.

1062
00:47:42,544 --> 00:47:45,045
    My strategy is just make
     them the same size and

1063
00:47:45,047 --> 00:47:48,447
   make the space in between
       them, be the same.

1064
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,450
       But, I bet there's
   probably a way to do it by

1065
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:54,919
  lining up their centers, or
   something like that, too.

1066
00:47:54,921 --> 00:47:56,921
        So I'm not going
        to use this one.

1067
00:47:56,923 --> 00:47:59,357
       The next one over,

1068
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:01,792
  right here, is the one that
     has the things I want.

1069
00:48:01,794 --> 00:48:04,094
       And so you can see
     that it'll ask you to

1070
00:48:04,096 --> 00:48:06,196
      make all the buttons
   equal widths and heights.

1071
00:48:06,198 --> 00:48:07,464
      Okay, not width and

1072
00:48:07,466 --> 00:48:09,832
    height, that fixes them
     at a certain width and

1073
00:48:09,834 --> 00:48:12,401
 height, this means that there,
   they can be any width and

1074
00:48:12,403 --> 00:48:14,803
 height they want, but they all
 have to be the same width and

1075
00:48:14,805 --> 00:48:16,938
   height all these buttons.

1076
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,840
   Of course I had these all
  selected by the way, if you

1077
00:48:18,842 --> 00:48:20,842
    don't have them selected
   it doesn't make any sense.

1078
00:48:22,011 --> 00:48:23,711
   And then up here, you can
    see there is spacing to

1079
00:48:23,713 --> 00:48:25,679
   nearest neighbor, so this
   is where I am going to set

1080
00:48:25,681 --> 00:48:29,716
    that spacing between all
     these, to be the same.

1081
00:48:29,718 --> 00:48:31,417
      And you can see that
      it's put eight here.

1082
00:48:31,419 --> 00:48:33,585
     That's because when I
     did the the dash lines

1083
00:48:35,022 --> 00:48:39,323
  to the top eight seems to be
  kind of a standard number of

1084
00:48:39,325 --> 00:48:42,727
    points between elements.

1085
00:48:42,729 --> 00:48:45,429
 These are all multiple because
     some of these buttons,

1086
00:48:45,431 --> 00:48:48,432
   their nearest neighbor is
  way over here and it's huge.

1087
00:48:48,434 --> 00:48:50,250
           All right.

1088
00:48:50,251 --> 00:48:52,067
   The bottom or their right.

1089
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:55,838
     But all these buttons,
       the thing on top,

1090
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,274
 whether it's another button or
    whether it's this label,

1091
00:48:58,276 --> 00:49:01,343
 all of them happen to be this
    eight points right here.

1092
00:49:01,345 --> 00:49:03,178
        So I want all of
       these to be eight.

1093
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:07,482
 So I'm just going to turn this
 bar on right here, which says,

1094
00:49:07,484 --> 00:49:11,018
    yes please enforce, and
   make the rule that all of

1095
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:15,255
 these are 8 points from their
  nearest neighbor to the top.

1096
00:49:15,257 --> 00:49:18,124
    And also, 8 to the left,
      8 to the right, and

1097
00:49:18,126 --> 00:49:19,459
        8 to the bottom.

1098
00:49:19,461 --> 00:49:21,060
     Really wanna make sure
      these beams are on,

1099
00:49:21,062 --> 00:49:23,362
    if these beams are off,
 even if there's a number here,

1100
00:49:23,364 --> 00:49:24,963
      then it's not gonna
         add this rule.

1101
00:49:24,965 --> 00:49:26,998
 So we wanted to add this rule.

1102
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,101
       So this adds up to
      87 different rules.

1103
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:32,554
   All these equal widths and

1104
00:49:32,555 --> 00:49:35,006
    heights and all these So
 if you don't have 87 in here,

1105
00:49:35,008 --> 00:49:36,974
    if it says a hundred and
           something,

1106
00:49:36,976 --> 00:49:39,209
    probably you don't have
   everything lined up right.

1107
00:49:39,211 --> 00:49:43,279
  It only takes 87 constraints
  to express all these rules.

1108
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:45,547
           All right.

1109
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:48,316
     Now, when I click this
    Add 87 Constraints it's

1110
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,886
    going to add these rules
   to all these buttons, and

1111
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:52,787
      watch what happens.

1112
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,723
    So, I get all kinds of,

1113
00:49:56,725 --> 00:49:59,392
     first these blue lines
   are showing me the rules.

1114
00:49:59,394 --> 00:50:01,094
             'Kay?
   A lot them are saying here

1115
00:50:01,096 --> 00:50:03,062
     that things are equal
      widths and heights.

1116
00:50:03,064 --> 00:50:05,531
       So these are what
      equals rules means.

1117
00:50:05,533 --> 00:50:08,700
  But there's also tiny little
     I beams right up here.

1118
00:50:08,702 --> 00:50:13,671
  That are showing this basing
    to nearest neighbor, and

1119
00:50:13,673 --> 00:50:16,073
  also like there's a yellow,
          yellow here.

1120
00:50:16,075 --> 00:50:18,409
          This yellow,
     remember, means yeah,

1121
00:50:18,411 --> 00:50:21,044
 there's constraints on these,
 but they're not actually where

1122
00:50:21,046 --> 00:50:23,113
     they're supposed to be
     based on those rules.

1123
00:50:24,049 --> 00:50:27,016
   So we really want to move
    them all to be in their

1124
00:50:27,018 --> 00:50:29,852
      proper spaces based
        on these rules.

1125
00:50:29,854 --> 00:50:31,753
    That's what these dashed
       yellow lines mean.

1126
00:50:31,755 --> 00:50:33,221
     So we can do the same
       thing to do that,

1127
00:50:33,223 --> 00:50:36,224
  that we did at the beginning
   with the label on the top

1128
00:50:36,226 --> 00:50:38,225
       which is go to our
     document outline here,

1129
00:50:38,227 --> 00:50:39,393
   in the lower left corner.

1130
00:50:39,395 --> 00:50:42,929
    Okay these are document
  outline when we last saw it,

1131
00:50:42,931 --> 00:50:45,331
        it only had this
      one label in there.

1132
00:50:46,401 --> 00:50:47,700
      Now we got all these
         buttons added.

1133
00:50:47,702 --> 00:50:50,002
        And you can see
     they're all selected.

1134
00:50:50,004 --> 00:50:52,304
   All selected here as well.

1135
00:50:52,306 --> 00:50:54,673
   And, we've got this little
     yellow thing up here.

1136
00:50:54,675 --> 00:50:58,643
   Now, if this is red, okay,
     if you do all this and

1137
00:50:58,645 --> 00:51:02,747
  this is red, well that means
    that you've got not just

1138
00:51:02,749 --> 00:51:05,516
 warnings that your constraints
 aren't in the right place, but

1139
00:51:05,518 --> 00:51:08,452
   you've got errors, usually
    conflicting constraints,

1140
00:51:08,454 --> 00:51:11,721
       where you've asked
         auto layout to

1141
00:51:11,723 --> 00:51:13,890
     enforce two rules that
   conflict with each other.

1142
00:51:13,892 --> 00:51:17,626
   So if you get to that red,
   this is not going to work.

1143
00:51:17,628 --> 00:51:20,295
 So, you'll want to start over,
              and

1144
00:51:20,297 --> 00:51:23,432
 I'll show you in a minute how
 you can start over if things,

1145
00:51:23,434 --> 00:51:26,234
   or not going your way, but
 if it's yellow that just means

1146
00:51:26,236 --> 00:51:27,201
         things were in
        the wrong place.

1147
00:51:27,203 --> 00:51:29,136
         So no problem,
      we click the yellow.

1148
00:51:29,138 --> 00:51:30,637
   Here's all the things that
    were in the wrong place.

1149
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:31,972
    This is all the buttons,

1150
00:51:31,974 --> 00:51:34,274
   you can see they highlight
     as I mouse over them.

1151
00:51:34,276 --> 00:51:38,077
   And you can really pick on
  any one of them to fix this

1152
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,880
 because there's a nice little
  switch here called apply to

1153
00:51:40,882 --> 00:51:42,047
   all views and containers.

1154
00:51:42,049 --> 00:51:44,116
       You don't have to
     click on each one and

1155
00:51:44,118 --> 00:51:46,985
    have it to frame update
      to the proper thing.

1156
00:51:46,987 --> 00:51:50,588
    You can just click quite
 obvious in container and it's

1157
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:55,125
 going to move the frame of all
  the buttons top fix the fact

1158
00:51:55,127 --> 00:51:57,494
   that they're in the wrong
  place based on their rules.

1159
00:51:57,496 --> 00:51:59,096
       So let's try that.

1160
00:51:59,097 --> 00:52:00,697
   I'm gonna hit this button
    here, Fix Misplacement.

1161
00:52:01,933 --> 00:52:03,032
     And it moved them all.

1162
00:52:03,034 --> 00:52:03,966
    There's no more yellow.

1163
00:52:03,968 --> 00:52:06,101
 There's no auto layout issues.

1164
00:52:06,103 --> 00:52:07,435
             Okay.
      All looks good here.

1165
00:52:07,437 --> 00:52:09,070
        We can close our
       document outline.

1166
00:52:10,306 --> 00:52:13,440
    We zoom out, we can see,
  wow, it spread them all out.

1167
00:52:13,442 --> 00:52:14,675
             Okay?
            Because,

1168
00:52:14,677 --> 00:52:18,444
       maybe it's obeying
     those rules I gave it.

1169
00:52:18,446 --> 00:52:20,079
             Okay?

1170
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,713
    So let's now run this on
     some devices here and

1171
00:52:21,716 --> 00:52:23,182
   see what this looks like.

1172
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:30,221
  So turn off on an iPhone 6,
 which is a pretty tall device.

1173
00:52:30,223 --> 00:52:32,790
      It's made, you know,
     kind of tall and thin.

1174
00:52:32,792 --> 00:52:35,459
        So if this still
       works fine enter.

1175
00:52:35,461 --> 00:52:39,763
   69874 times 5 divide maybe
   square root something like

1176
00:52:39,765 --> 00:52:44,266
       that, it all seems
         to be working.

1177
00:52:44,268 --> 00:52:48,804
  Now, not only is it working
  here in this portrait mode,

1178
00:52:48,806 --> 00:52:51,023
         tall and thin.

1179
00:52:51,024 --> 00:52:53,241
 But if we go over here to this
   we can rotate the device.

1180
00:52:54,277 --> 00:52:55,843
            Okay, so
  I'm going to rotate left and

1181
00:52:55,845 --> 00:52:58,979
   right and use the command
        keys to do this.

1182
00:52:58,981 --> 00:53:02,449
   And we rotate it right and
           you see it

1183
00:53:02,451 --> 00:53:08,220
   may the buttons spread out
    to this new location and

1184
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:13,491
    we can rotate back using
     the command keys here.

1185
00:53:14,627 --> 00:53:17,461
      And it looks good in
      either orientation.

1186
00:53:17,463 --> 00:53:21,465
 And in fact, it can look good
   on other devices as well.

1187
00:53:21,467 --> 00:53:23,066
   So let's go over here and

1188
00:53:23,068 --> 00:53:26,235
   instead of doing iPhone 6,
 let's try it on an iPhone 4S.

1189
00:53:26,237 --> 00:53:27,937
            Okay so,

1190
00:53:27,939 --> 00:53:32,407
  gonna switch the simulation
     here, let's run that.

1191
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:37,345
   Now the iPhone 4s, you can
    see is a little shorter,

1192
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:39,280
    it's not quite as tall.

1193
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:42,416
   A little lower resolution,
           obviously.

1194
00:53:42,418 --> 00:53:46,986
 But it relayed out the buttons
 to look good in that case too.

1195
00:53:46,988 --> 00:53:52,558
    9 times 9, divided by 8,
    square root, et cetera.

1196
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:56,995
      And same thing here
       we can rotate and

1197
00:53:56,997 --> 00:54:00,131
   look at this one as well.

1198
00:54:00,133 --> 00:54:03,067
             Okay.

1199
00:54:03,069 --> 00:54:05,019
          All righty.

1200
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:06,970
 So the last thing I just want
  to talk about briefly is if

1201
00:54:06,973 --> 00:54:10,207
 you try this extra credit and
    it doesn't work for you.

1202
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:16,413
   Get all messed up, you can
 kind of start over by clicking

1203
00:54:16,415 --> 00:54:21,450
  on this and using the third
 button over here on the right.

1204
00:54:21,452 --> 00:54:23,852
     And this allows you to
   reset your constraints and

1205
00:54:23,854 --> 00:54:26,688
  you can see the top section
  here is the selected views.

1206
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:27,922
        I don't have any
        selected here so

1207
00:54:27,924 --> 00:54:29,257
        this wouldn't do
      anything right now.

1208
00:54:29,259 --> 00:54:31,659
     But the bottom is all
     views in container and

1209
00:54:31,661 --> 00:54:34,161
    I kinda recommend going
     down here to all views

1210
00:54:34,163 --> 00:54:37,164
     container and clearing
   the constraints entirely.

1211
00:54:37,166 --> 00:54:40,000
       Reset to suggested
    constraints and try and

1212
00:54:40,002 --> 00:54:44,437
 make some sense of your dashed
 lines but if it's not working,

1213
00:54:44,439 --> 00:54:47,673
    you're probably, you're
  dashed lines are off anyway.

1214
00:54:47,675 --> 00:54:49,875
  So you can just go here and

1215
00:54:49,877 --> 00:54:51,343
       Clear Constraints,
    that'll clear them all.

1216
00:54:51,345 --> 00:54:53,211
     Now that's gonna clear
   not just your buttons but

1217
00:54:53,213 --> 00:54:55,880
        also it's gonna
       clear your labels.

1218
00:54:55,882 --> 00:54:59,450
  So you'll have to reposition
 your label with blue lines and

1219
00:54:59,452 --> 00:55:02,953
    use control drag to say
    your top space, and, and

1220
00:55:02,955 --> 00:55:05,388
   all that stuff, you know?

1221
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:08,458
   If your buttons are really
  huge, they got really huge,

1222
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,726
  but they're not in the right
 place, you can actually change

1223
00:55:10,728 --> 00:55:13,595
  the size of all your buttons
    in the utilities window.

1224
00:55:14,565 --> 00:55:16,164
     You can go to the size
     inspector right here,

1225
00:55:16,166 --> 00:55:19,467
    that's this one, you can
 actually type in the width and

1226
00:55:19,469 --> 00:55:22,370
      the height you want
  the buttons to be, make them

1227
00:55:22,372 --> 00:55:25,272
     smaller again, which,
   you know, maybe 64 by 64.

1228
00:55:25,274 --> 00:55:29,376
 That might make them easier to
 re-drag them into position so

1229
00:55:29,378 --> 00:55:31,210
  the blue lines are working.

1230
00:55:32,313 --> 00:55:36,015
   And don't forget the very
 important blue line dragging,

1231
00:55:36,017 --> 00:55:38,283
   which is you want to take
  the whole grid and drag it,

1232
00:55:38,285 --> 00:55:40,285
      so that it's sitting
     underneath your label.

1233
00:55:41,654 --> 00:55:44,021
 If you have problems dragging
 the whole grid underneath your

1234
00:55:44,023 --> 00:55:46,490
     label, sometimes it's
     a good idea, clear all

1235
00:55:46,492 --> 00:55:48,892
 your constraints, kind of move
  your buttons out of the way,

1236
00:55:48,894 --> 00:55:51,761
  just kind of move them down
  to the bottom here and then

1237
00:55:51,763 --> 00:55:56,132
 just for your label, do reset
  to suggest your constraint.

1238
00:55:56,134 --> 00:55:57,499
   This top one selected view

1239
00:55:57,501 --> 00:56:01,036
  Rest Suggestion Constraints
     cuz that will work for

1240
00:56:01,038 --> 00:56:03,204
    the label if you move it
    into position as long as

1241
00:56:03,206 --> 00:56:06,407
  the buttons aren't too close
 and it thinks that, you know.

1242
00:56:06,409 --> 00:56:08,042
     Those buttons are near
    neighbors or something.

1243
00:56:09,145 --> 00:56:11,945
 And sometimes resetting it to
  suggest the constraints will

1244
00:56:11,947 --> 00:56:17,483
  make it so that, that bottom
   edge of your UI label will

1245
00:56:17,485 --> 00:56:21,253
  be attainable when you drag
  your buttons into position.

1246
00:56:22,289 --> 00:56:23,538
       But again, not to

1247
00:56:23,539 --> 00:56:24,788
      worry too much about
    this auto layout stuff.

1248
00:56:25,825 --> 00:56:27,158
       It's extra credit
       in assignment one.

1249
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,493
   It's not going to be extra
   credit in assignment two,

1250
00:56:29,495 --> 00:56:31,728
      so you're eventually
    going to have to do it.

1251
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:34,197
  I'm going to be giving a big
 lecture on this in a couple of

1252
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:35,465
     weeks, on auto layout.

1253
00:56:35,467 --> 00:56:38,968
   I've really just shown you
  just kind of what it can do,

1254
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:41,770
        I haven't really
      taught you how to do

1255
00:56:41,772 --> 00:56:43,338
   auto layout in particular.

1256
00:56:44,374 --> 00:56:48,409
 Auto layout is very important
    because we work in this

1257
00:56:48,411 --> 00:56:50,745
        square area and

1258
00:56:50,746 --> 00:56:53,080
 we want our UIs to work on all
  kinds of different devices.

1259
00:56:53,082 --> 00:56:54,614
        That's why we're
    starting off in the very

1260
00:56:55,584 --> 00:56:57,717
        start with some
      experience with it.

1261
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:00,686
           All right.

1262
00:57:00,688 --> 00:57:02,520
         So that is it.

1263
00:57:02,522 --> 00:57:06,190
       Now, later today,
  I'm gonna, in this lecture,

1264
00:57:06,192 --> 00:57:10,828
   I'm gonna give you a talk
   about this design paradigm

1265
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:14,197
 called model-view-controller,
  and we actually designed our

1266
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:17,300
   calculator kind of poorly,
         because all of

1267
00:57:17,302 --> 00:57:20,436
    this code here is really
     nothing to do with UI.

1268
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:26,141
 This is all calculator brain,
    calculator engine code.

1269
00:57:26,143 --> 00:57:28,143
    And this really wants to
  meet a different object and

1270
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:30,211
 that's what NBC is all about.

1271
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:33,648
   And so I'll give a little
  talk about NBC later today.

1272
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:36,650
   And then on Monday, we're
  going to fix our calculator

1273
00:57:36,652 --> 00:57:41,855
  to obey MVC and be a proper
   citizen in the iOS world,

1274
00:57:41,857 --> 00:57:45,258
  where all apps need to obey
  model V controller paradigm.

1275
00:57:46,294 --> 00:57:49,261
      >> So let's try and
 understand for, I mean half of

1276
00:57:49,263 --> 00:57:52,764
   you said that you already
   know MVC or you've seen it

1277
00:57:52,766 --> 00:57:54,499
   somewhere else so, this is
   going to be mostly review.

1278
00:57:54,501 --> 00:57:57,769
   But the other half of you,
  this will hopefully give you

1279
00:57:57,771 --> 00:58:00,705
        an idea of what
       MVC is all about.

1280
00:58:00,707 --> 00:58:04,975
      So MVC is basically
 a mechanism where we divide up

1281
00:58:04,977 --> 00:58:09,379
     all the objects in our
    application into one of

1282
00:58:09,381 --> 00:58:11,180
       these three camps.

1283
00:58:11,182 --> 00:58:12,281
             Okay?

1284
00:58:12,283 --> 00:58:14,182
      So, the three camps.

1285
00:58:14,184 --> 00:58:15,884
       On the left there
       you see the model.

1286
00:58:15,886 --> 00:58:19,220
 So, the model camp is gonna be
 all the objects that are what

1287
00:58:19,222 --> 00:58:21,355
     your application does.

1288
00:58:21,357 --> 00:58:24,858
  So, for our calculator its,
         it calculates.

1289
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,794
   Okay, that's what it does.

1290
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:28,729
  So, all the parts what we're
  doing perform operation, and

1291
00:58:28,731 --> 00:58:32,098
   all that stuff, that's all
   kind of calculator stuff.

1292
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:35,935
 That should be in a calculator
     object somewhere else,

1293
00:58:35,937 --> 00:58:37,569
       it shouldn't be in
        our controller.

1294
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:43,841
  And then the second camp is
 the controller, the controller

1295
00:58:43,843 --> 00:58:48,178
     controls how the model
    is presented on screen.

1296
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:51,348
  And the view is the minions,
        the classes that

1297
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:52,916
    the controller is going
       to use are kind of

1298
00:58:52,918 --> 00:58:55,485
 like the the building blocks,
       the Lincoln Logs,

1299
00:58:55,487 --> 00:58:57,520
      I know maybe that's
    before all of your time.

1300
00:58:57,522 --> 00:59:00,289
  But, you know, these things
 we're gong to do to build our

1301
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:02,524
       UI, we're going to
        use in the view.

1302
00:59:02,526 --> 00:59:06,127
   So the stuff that's in the
 view is pretty generic, okay,

1303
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:07,795
      generic UI elements.

1304
00:59:07,797 --> 00:59:10,030
  The stuff in the controller
      is very specific to

1305
00:59:10,032 --> 00:59:11,498
       how your UI works.

1306
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,600
   And the stuff in the model
  is completely independent of

1307
00:59:13,602 --> 00:59:15,234
       how your UI works.

1308
00:59:15,236 --> 00:59:15,801
             Okay?

1309
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:22,007
  So doing MVC right is about
  knowing where things go but

1310
00:59:22,009 --> 00:59:25,543
 also about how to communicate
   between these three camps.

1311
00:59:25,545 --> 00:59:27,412
     And so we can try and
         summarize how

1312
00:59:27,414 --> 00:59:29,113
    the communication works
    between these camps, and

1313
00:59:29,115 --> 00:59:32,182
  I've used road markings, you
 see the double yellow line and

1314
00:59:32,184 --> 00:59:33,350
  then the dashed white line.

1315
00:59:33,352 --> 00:59:34,884
     So that's like you're
      driving in your car.

1316
00:59:35,887 --> 00:59:40,356
  Try to use them as an image
   for how this communication

1317
00:59:40,358 --> 00:59:42,090
  happens, where it's allowed,
    where it's not allowed.

1318
00:59:43,093 --> 00:59:45,693
      So let's talk about
   the Controller talking to

1319
00:59:45,695 --> 00:59:47,294
           the Model.

1320
00:59:47,296 --> 00:59:50,097
  Going from that side of the
 road over to the Model side is

1321
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:51,565
      a dashed white line,
        in other words,

1322
00:59:51,567 --> 00:59:52,799
       you can head right
         across there.

1323
00:59:52,801 --> 00:59:54,267
      You probably want to
    look before you go, but

1324
00:59:54,269 --> 00:59:56,603
 you can go right across, okay?

1325
00:59:56,604 --> 00:59:58,938
   The controller has to know
  everything about the model,

1326
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:01,740
  and it has to have complete
       ability to talk to

1327
01:00:01,742 --> 01:00:04,776
   the model, use its public
    API as much as it wants

1328
01:00:04,778 --> 01:00:08,313
  because the controller's job
   is to present the model to

1329
01:00:08,315 --> 01:00:10,848
       the user using its
      view as its minions.

1330
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:12,650
 So it has to have this access.

1331
01:00:12,652 --> 01:00:16,319
 That full, unrestricted access
 the controller has talking to

1332
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,320
           the model.

1333
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,354
    This is a one way arrow.

1334
01:00:18,356 --> 01:00:20,289
          Control, or

1335
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:22,223
      one way arrow, from
  the controller to the model.

1336
01:00:22,226 --> 01:00:25,160
      And similarly, from
  the controller to the view,

1337
01:00:25,162 --> 01:00:27,095
       is also unlimited
         communication,

1338
01:00:27,097 --> 01:00:28,830
     because the controller
       is responsible for

1339
01:00:28,832 --> 01:00:30,798
         talking using
       it's own minions.

1340
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,667
 The view is, the controller's
         new meaning is

1341
01:00:32,669 --> 01:00:35,569
 to lay out the user interface
      and all that stuff.

1342
01:00:35,571 --> 01:00:37,671
     So, the controller can
     do anything it wants.

1343
01:00:37,673 --> 01:00:39,305
 I put that little green word,
            outlet,

1344
01:00:39,307 --> 01:00:42,809
 up there because when we have
   a property of a controller

1345
01:00:42,811 --> 01:00:46,278
   that points into the view,
  we call it an outlet, okay?

1346
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,213
   And you're gonna see that
   in the demo on Wednesday.

1347
01:00:48,215 --> 01:00:51,249
 I'm gonna say, oh let's create
 an outlet from our controller

1348
01:00:51,251 --> 01:00:52,634
         to our view so

1349
01:00:52,635 --> 01:00:54,018
    our controller can talk
    to it's view, all right?

1350
01:00:55,055 --> 01:00:56,354
 What about this communication?

1351
01:00:56,356 --> 01:00:57,554
         Model to view?

1352
01:00:57,556 --> 01:00:58,422
             Never.

1353
01:00:58,424 --> 01:00:59,989
        And why is that?

1354
01:00:59,991 --> 01:01:03,292
   100% obvious, the model is
   completely UI independent.

1355
01:01:03,294 --> 01:01:05,494
     So, there's absolutely
    no way it could talk to

1356
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:07,863
       a viewer object or
      anyone in that camp.

1357
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:10,399
    Because the view objects
 are fundamentally UI objects.

1358
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:11,466
  They're kind of generic, but

1359
01:01:11,468 --> 01:01:13,401
         they're still
   fundamentally UI objects.

1360
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:16,237
   Similarly, since the view
  objects are kind of generic,

1361
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:18,272
     they can't be talking
     to any specific model.

1362
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:20,674
     They need a controller
      to interpret a model

1363
01:01:20,676 --> 01:01:22,375
        for them, okay?

1364
01:01:22,377 --> 01:01:24,377
      So there's never any
    communication this way.

1365
01:01:24,379 --> 01:01:25,911
        That's why it's
     a double yellow line.

1366
01:01:25,913 --> 01:01:27,780
        That's why these
         lines are red.

1367
01:01:27,782 --> 01:01:29,748
 That's why there's fire, okay?

1368
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,783
   Never go across that line,
             ever.

1369
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,520
  What about the view talking
    back to the controller?

1370
01:01:36,522 --> 01:01:38,588
   You got these generic view
     objects, like buttons.

1371
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:40,724
        Can they talk to
        the controller?

1372
01:01:40,726 --> 01:01:43,593
      Well, yes, they can.

1373
01:01:43,595 --> 01:01:46,495
  But, they have to be careful
    because the view objects

1374
01:01:46,497 --> 01:01:48,397
          are generic.

1375
01:01:48,398 --> 01:01:50,298
   So they can't really know
   much about the controller.

1376
01:01:50,301 --> 01:01:53,201
 So, they can only communicate
     back to the controller

1377
01:01:53,203 --> 01:01:55,437
   in a blind way where they
    don't know the class of

1378
01:01:55,439 --> 01:01:58,673
 the thing they're talking to,
    and in a structured way.

1379
01:01:58,675 --> 01:02:02,776
 A way where we all agree we're
   gonna communicate this way

1380
01:02:02,778 --> 01:02:03,844
      between the view and
        the controller.

1381
01:02:03,846 --> 01:02:05,512
      So, whats an example
      of a structured way?

1382
01:02:05,514 --> 01:02:07,480
       Well one is called
         target action.

1383
01:02:07,482 --> 01:02:10,816
  So, the controller basically
 drops a target on itself, and

1384
01:02:10,818 --> 01:02:15,087
  then it hands out an action,
    which is like an arrow,

1385
01:02:15,089 --> 01:02:17,389
        to the view and
       says to the view,

1386
01:02:17,391 --> 01:02:20,058
 okay, when you do what you do,
    like you're a button and

1387
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,659
     someone touches you or
       your a slider and

1388
01:02:21,661 --> 01:02:24,828
       someone moves you,
      send me that action.

1389
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:26,430
             Okay?

1390
01:02:26,431 --> 01:02:28,031
        So, in this way,
     the generic button or

1391
01:02:28,033 --> 01:02:30,600
    slider is communicating
    back to the controller.

1392
01:02:30,602 --> 01:02:32,835
    It has no idea that it's
   a card game controller or

1393
01:02:32,837 --> 01:02:34,103
    a space game controller.

1394
01:02:34,105 --> 01:02:36,071
      It doesn't know what
   kind of controller it is.

1395
01:02:36,073 --> 01:02:38,607
   All it knows is that when
  something happens in itself,

1396
01:02:38,609 --> 01:02:40,108
    boom, it sends a message
         to the target.

1397
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:43,678
   So that's a blind, simple,
       structured way for

1398
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,780
    the view to communicate
      with the controller.

1399
01:02:45,782 --> 01:02:47,465
             Okay?

1400
01:02:47,466 --> 01:02:49,149
      But what about more
       complicated ways?

1401
01:02:49,151 --> 01:02:52,119
   Sometimes the view, things
   are happening in the view

1402
01:02:52,121 --> 01:02:53,987
 that are somewhat complicated,
              and

1403
01:02:53,989 --> 01:02:56,456
   the controller needs to be
  informed of what's going on,

1404
01:02:56,458 --> 01:02:58,791
      synchronizing what's
           happening.

1405
01:02:58,793 --> 01:03:01,694
   And one way to think about
     this is these words I

1406
01:03:01,696 --> 01:03:04,096
       put up here, will,
        should and did.

1407
01:03:04,098 --> 01:03:06,598
 When the view is kind of like,

1408
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,132
       let's say I am in
      the scroll view and

1409
01:03:08,134 --> 01:03:11,669
   I am scrolling around, and
  I want to let the controller

1410
01:03:11,671 --> 01:03:15,806
       somebody know that
   the user just did scroll.

1411
01:03:15,808 --> 01:03:17,691
             Okay?
               Or

1412
01:03:17,692 --> 01:03:19,575
  the user puts down the touch
 and is about to scroll, I want

1413
01:03:19,578 --> 01:03:23,413
 to let the controller know the
 user will be scrolling, okay?

1414
01:03:23,415 --> 01:03:25,114
       Or, the user puts
       the touch down and

1415
01:03:25,116 --> 01:03:26,448
       the scroll viewer
         wants to know,

1416
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:30,452
   should I allow the user to
 scroll here, is that allowed?

1417
01:03:30,454 --> 01:03:33,221
  All those things, the scroll
     view itself might not

1418
01:03:33,223 --> 01:03:36,190
   have enough logic to know
 the answer to those questions.

1419
01:03:36,192 --> 01:03:39,727
      So what it does is,
 it delegates the authority to

1420
01:03:39,729 --> 01:03:42,730
     answer those questions
     to some other object.

1421
01:03:42,732 --> 01:03:44,664
      Now, it doesn't know
   the class of that object.

1422
01:03:44,666 --> 01:03:46,199
      All it knows is that
        other object can

1423
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:49,135
 answer these questions, will,
  should, did, this, that, or

1424
01:03:49,137 --> 01:03:51,570
     the other thing like,
    should allow scrolling.

1425
01:03:51,572 --> 01:03:53,939
      Did scroll to point.

1426
01:03:53,941 --> 01:03:54,539
       Things like that.

1427
01:03:54,541 --> 01:03:56,591
    So those are the kind of

1428
01:03:56,592 --> 01:03:58,642
  methods you are going to see
  in these delicate protocols.

1429
01:03:58,645 --> 01:04:00,878
  Now, I know this here is 1,
           6 a and b,

1430
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,847
    do not teach protocols.

1431
01:04:02,849 --> 01:04:04,582
   How many people know what

1432
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:06,316
   the word protocol means an
  object during a programming?

1433
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:07,117
   I can see very few of you.

1434
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:08,818
  So, I will be teaching that.

1435
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:12,421
 A protocol is just a blind way
   to talk to another object.

1436
01:04:12,423 --> 01:04:13,556
        When I teach it,

1437
01:04:13,557 --> 01:04:14,690
    you're gonna be like oh,
   yeah, I know what that is.

1438
01:04:14,692 --> 01:04:16,958
    So we can really call it
     protocol or whatever.

1439
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,160
      But that's how we do
       delegation, okay,

1440
01:04:19,162 --> 01:04:20,862
   this blind communication.

1441
01:04:21,931 --> 01:04:24,932
          Also another
       important thing is

1442
01:04:24,934 --> 01:04:28,502
 that views should not own the
 data that they're displaying.

1443
01:04:28,504 --> 01:04:30,170
    They should not own it.

1444
01:04:30,171 --> 01:04:31,837
  In other words, it shouldn't
 be a property inside of them,

1445
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,707
     where that's the truth
         of that data.

1446
01:04:34,709 --> 01:04:37,810
  And the easiest example for
   this is, all the songs in

1447
01:04:37,812 --> 01:04:40,679
  your iPod, on your iPhone or
       your iPad, right?

1448
01:04:40,681 --> 01:04:43,281
     You might have 10,000
        songs in there.

1449
01:04:43,283 --> 01:04:46,017
   So, if you have some kind
    of generic list view in

1450
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:50,354
 your view, you can't transfer
    all 10,000 songs to its

1451
01:04:50,356 --> 01:04:52,773
    instance variables, and

1452
01:04:52,774 --> 01:04:55,191
 expect it to hold 10,000 songs
   so it can list through it.

1453
01:04:55,194 --> 01:04:56,860
 A, that would be inefficient,
              and

1454
01:04:56,862 --> 01:05:01,064
   B that information, those
  10,000 songs belongs where?

1455
01:05:01,066 --> 01:05:02,131
         In the model.

1456
01:05:02,133 --> 01:05:04,900
    Okay, because your song
      database is a model.

1457
01:05:04,902 --> 01:05:06,468
 It has nothing to do with UI.

1458
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,035
 It's just a list of songs and
     artists and albums and

1459
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:09,604
  all that, it's in the model.

1460
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:12,073
     Some controller has to
   look at that database and

1461
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:16,243
       tell a view how to
    display all those songs.

1462
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:18,429
             Okay?

1463
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:20,614
 So, we need that communication
 to happen here and the view is

1464
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:23,249
 displaying some sort of list,
  and you're touching down and

1465
01:05:23,251 --> 01:05:26,619
  you're flicking on the list
 and trying to see more songs,

1466
01:05:26,621 --> 01:05:28,087
         how does that
     communication happen?

1467
01:05:28,089 --> 01:05:30,923
   And the answer is, we have
    another special kind of

1468
01:05:30,925 --> 01:05:33,992
       delegate, which we
      call a data source.

1469
01:05:33,994 --> 01:05:36,928
  Now the data source doesn't
    do the will did should.

1470
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:39,230
      It's gonna be asking
     questions like count,

1471
01:05:39,232 --> 01:05:41,098
 like how many songs are there?

1472
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,900
       And the controller
      looks in the model,

1473
01:05:42,902 --> 01:05:45,435
  10,000 response to the view.

1474
01:05:45,437 --> 01:05:47,020
        There's 10,000.
            The view

1475
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:48,604
   makes space internally for
         10,000 things.

1476
01:05:48,607 --> 01:05:50,340
 It doesn't know what they are.

1477
01:05:50,342 --> 01:05:53,009
      Moves the scroll bar
   indicator a little bit so

1478
01:05:53,011 --> 01:05:54,276
   that you know where it is.

1479
01:05:54,278 --> 01:05:57,779
 And then you start scrolling,
    flipping through it, and

1480
01:05:57,781 --> 01:06:00,849
 it starts sending the message
       to the controller,

1481
01:06:00,851 --> 01:06:03,785
      give me the data at
    line 150 next 10 items.

1482
01:06:03,787 --> 01:06:04,975
      You see what I mean?

1483
01:06:04,976 --> 01:06:06,164
       And then you flick
        down some more.

1484
01:06:06,165 --> 01:06:07,353
      Now it's saying 250,
         10 more items.

1485
01:06:07,357 --> 01:06:10,257
  And so the control is going
     back to the model and

1486
01:06:10,259 --> 01:06:11,725
      saying give me more,
       give me more data.

1487
01:06:11,727 --> 01:06:14,361
    And it's providing it to
  the view in this blind way.

1488
01:06:14,363 --> 01:06:17,230
   So to see how the view is
  getting data from the model

1489
01:06:17,232 --> 01:06:20,232
 through the controller in this
 kind of blind structured way.

1490
01:06:20,234 --> 01:06:21,767
             Okay?

1491
01:06:21,768 --> 01:06:23,301
 That makes sense to everybody?

1492
01:06:23,304 --> 01:06:24,970
     So data source is just
      a kind of delegate,

1493
01:06:24,972 --> 01:06:27,105
    it's a specific kind of
   delegate for getting data.

1494
01:06:27,107 --> 01:06:30,408
 So you're gonna see that there
  are classes in iOS that have

1495
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:33,477
    a data source, and they
 usually also have a delegate.

1496
01:06:33,479 --> 01:06:36,547
 Most sophisticated classes in
 iOS have a delegate, the will,

1497
01:06:36,549 --> 01:06:38,415
  did, should, kind of things.

1498
01:06:38,417 --> 01:06:40,316
       Some of them have
         a data source,

1499
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:43,219
 it depends on whether they are
 showing a lot of data or not.

1500
01:06:43,221 --> 01:06:46,455
 Now simple data, like if I had 
  a view, if I invented a view  
 一些简单的数据，比如我给纸牌游戏

1501
01:06:46,457 --> 01:06:49,224
    for my card game called     
     playing card view and      
     创建了一个叫playing card view的视图

1502
01:06:49,226 --> 01:06:51,109
 it just has a suit and a rank. 
 它仅有花色和点数两点属性。

1503
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:52,993
    Okay, we're not going to    
     do count data app for   
     我们不会为了花色和点数

1504
01:06:52,996 --> 01:06:54,262
      just suit and rank.     
进行计算。

1505
01:06:54,264 --> 01:06:56,030
      We are going to set       
       those properties. 
       我们会把它们设置成属性。

1506
01:06:56,032 --> 01:06:58,766
   And so the view then would   
  have that data set in it but  
  所以view里会有设置好的数据，但是

1507
01:06:58,768 --> 01:07:00,267
   it wouldn't be owning it. 
   它不会拥有这些数据。   

1508
01:07:00,269 --> 01:07:02,536
             Right?             
    The model would still be    
    model仍然会是花色和点数的

1509
01:07:02,538 --> 01:07:04,571
      owning the suit and 
      拥有者，      

1510
01:07:04,572 --> 01:07:06,605
 rank, the view is just getting 
    that data to present it.    
    view仅仅是为了显示而获取那些数据。

1511
01:07:06,608 --> 01:07:07,840
             'Kay.              
        So simple data,
        所以对于简单的数据，         

1512
01:07:07,842 --> 01:07:10,743
      we might transfer to      
  the view but it's merely for  
  我们会把它传送到view里，但是

1513
01:07:10,745 --> 01:07:12,878
       it to display it.     
       只是给view来显示。   

1514
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,312
             Okay.         

1515
01:07:14,314 --> 01:07:17,615
      This all adds up to       
 the controller's job being to  
 所以controller的工作就是

1516
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:22,520
      interpret and format      
 the model's data for the view. 
 给view解释并格式化这些model提供的数据。

1517
01:07:22,522 --> 01:07:23,654
  That's the controller's job.  
  这就是controller的工作。

1518
01:07:23,656 --> 01:07:25,188
    And when we do our demo,    
    在我们做deomo的时候，

1519
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:28,758
 I'm going to be marking like,  
 oh see I'm writing this code.  
 我会在写代码的时候提示大家，

1520
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,494
 This is to make the controller 
        perform its job,
 这段代码是为了让controller执行它的工作，        

1521
01:07:31,496 --> 01:07:34,430
        which is to take        
       the model data and       
       也就是从model中取出数据然后

1522
01:07:34,432 --> 01:07:36,265
     using its view minion      
      to put it on screen. 
      运用到view中去，然后显示到屏幕上。

1523
01:07:36,267 --> 01:07:37,132
             Okay?              
          That's what           
          这就是

1524
01:07:37,134 --> 01:07:38,667
      the controller does.      
      controller做的事情。

1525
01:07:38,669 --> 01:07:40,468
 What about this communication? 
 那关于通信呢？

1526
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:42,970
       Can the model talk       
       to the controller?       
       model可以和controller通信吗？

1527
01:07:42,972 --> 01:07:46,040
    Again, obviously that's     
  verboten because model knows  
同样的，显然是不可以。因为model对于UI

1528
01:07:46,042 --> 01:07:47,708
      nothing about UI, so      
      一无所知，所以

1529
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:50,710
 it couldn't possibly talk to a 
 UI object like the controller. 
 它不可能同像controller一样的UI对象进行通信。

1530
01:07:50,712 --> 01:07:53,046
      But sometimes things      
    change in the model, and    
    但是有些时候，model中的数据变了，

1531
01:07:53,048 --> 01:07:54,580
    the controller needs to     
      know about it, okay?      
      controller需要只要这个变化，OK?

1532
01:07:54,582 --> 01:07:56,782
         Data changes,          
     a database changes or      
     数据改变了，数据库改变了，或者

1533
01:07:56,784 --> 01:07:59,017
       the model is some        
     network database, and    
     model是网络数据库，  

1534
01:07:59,019 --> 01:08:01,186
 somebody changes something on  
  the network and it changes.   
  某人在网络上修改了数据，数据改变了。

1535
01:08:01,188 --> 01:08:02,587
       And the controller       
       needs to find out.       
       controller需要了解这些。

1536
01:08:02,589 --> 01:08:04,555
        So, how do we do        
      that communication?    
      所以，我们怎样做这种通信呢？   

1537
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:09,592
    We do that using kind of    
     a radio station model.  
     这可以通过一种电台的模型来理解

1538
01:08:09,594 --> 01:08:11,928
             Okay?              

1539
01:08:11,929 --> 01:08:14,263
 So, the model, a radio station 
  concept, the model will use   
  所以，model是一种电台的概念，

1540
01:08:14,265 --> 01:08:17,866
  this concept to essentially   
    broadcast information to 
    model将会利用这一 概念，把信息广播给   

1541
01:08:17,868 --> 01:08:19,768
    anyone who's interested.    
    感兴趣的任何人。

1542
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:21,937
             Okay?              

1543
01:08:21,938 --> 01:08:24,105
     And the mechanisms for     
  doing this in iOS are called  
  在iOS中为了解决这种问题而使用的技术我们叫做

1544
01:08:24,107 --> 01:08:28,476
   Notification and Key Value   
   Observing, KVO we call it.   
   Notification和KVO。

1545
01:08:28,478 --> 01:08:31,211
     And so, the model can      
     just say, oh, anytime      
     所以，model可以说，

1546
01:08:31,213 --> 01:08:33,547
 something changes in my model  
  I'm just gonna broadcast on   
我当中的任何东西发生了变化，我会通过我的电台

1547
01:08:33,549 --> 01:08:37,484
 my radio station, and then the 
  controller simply tunes into  
  广播一下，随后，controller

1548
01:08:37,486 --> 01:08:40,453
 that radio station, and he can 
 find out things are changing.  
 会接收到来自电台的信息，它会发现数据在变化

1549
01:08:40,455 --> 01:08:42,254
     And when he finds out      
       something changes,       
       发现数据变化以后，

1550
01:08:42,256 --> 01:08:46,058
 it's gonna communicate via its 
  green arrow to the model and  
  它就会通过它的绿剪头同model进行通信，

1551
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,659
       say, okay, give me       
    that data that changed.     
    给我那个改变过的数据。

1552
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:49,560
             Right?   

1553
01:08:49,562 --> 01:08:50,978
        That make sense?        
        能听懂吗？

1554
01:08:50,979 --> 01:08:52,395
     So, towards the end of     
 the quarter we'll start seeing 
 所以在课程快要结束的时候，我们将会学习

1555
01:08:52,398 --> 01:08:54,531
       a little how to do       
 notification to find out, for
 如何利用通知得知

1556
01:08:54,533 --> 01:08:57,334
      example, if the data      
     in a database changes.     
     数据库中的数据发生了改变。

1557
01:08:57,336 --> 01:09:00,070
   We'll get a notification,    
   the UI can then, you know, 
   我们将会获取这个通知，UI中的controller  

1558
01:09:00,072 --> 01:09:03,272
  controller can then go talk   
 to the model to get the info.  
 随后可以同model通信来获取信息。

1559
01:09:05,309 --> 01:09:06,286
             Okay?         

1560
01:09:06,287 --> 01:09:07,264
    Some people have asked,     
    有些人会问，

1561
01:09:07,265 --> 01:09:08,242
      can a view tune into      
       the radio station?       
       view可以接收广播吗？

1562
01:09:08,245 --> 01:09:09,878
    They probably could, but    
    它们也许可以，但是

1563
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,179
     you probably wouldn't      
        want to do that.        
        你最好不要这样做。

1564
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:12,980
     That would probably be     
      a violation of MVC.       
      这可能违背了MVC的原则。

1565
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,749
           All right.     
           好的。      

1566
01:09:14,751 --> 01:09:16,750
         So we do this.         
         我们这样做，

1567
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:18,785
     We have all this nice      
       communication and        
       我们有这些很好的通信和

1568
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:21,288
        all these rules,        
        所有的这些规则。

1569
01:09:21,289 --> 01:09:23,790
  and we can imagine building   
  something simple using this.  
  我们可以利用这些来制作一些小的应用。

1570
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:26,259
   But what if we wanna build   
     a big complicated app?     
     但是如果我们想要制作一个巨大复杂的应用呢？

1571
01:09:26,261 --> 01:09:28,861
    An app that has multiple    
   screens on our iPhone, or  
   一个在iPhone或iPad上运行，有多个屏幕，  

1572
01:09:28,863 --> 01:09:30,863
   an iPad, it's got three or   
   在屏幕上有三个或四个不同的区域，

1573
01:09:30,865 --> 01:09:34,166
 four different areas on screen 
  where things are happening. 
    都发生着事情。

1574
01:09:34,168 --> 01:09:35,433
       How do we do that?       
       我们该怎么做？

1575
01:09:35,435 --> 01:09:36,834
          Well, we're           
      essentially going to      
      我们

1576
01:09:36,836 --> 01:09:40,071
  combine multiple MVCs, okay?  
  会结合多个MVC

1577
01:09:40,073 --> 01:09:47,244
 Because an MVC can use as part 
   of its view, another MVC.    
因为一个MVC可以将另一个MVC当做视图的一部分。

1578
01:09:47,246 --> 01:09:48,311
             Okay?           

1579
01:09:48,313 --> 01:09:52,114
           So an MVC,           
  an entire MVC can be one of   
  所以一个完整的MVC可以被一个稍大些的

1580
01:09:52,116 --> 01:09:56,051
         the minions of         
        some bigger MVC.       
        MVC当做仆人使用。 

1581
01:09:56,053 --> 01:09:57,803
             'Kay?      

1582
01:09:57,804 --> 01:09:59,554
     And by doing that and      
       cascading it down,       
       我们可以一层一层地这样堆叠，

1583
01:09:59,556 --> 01:10:01,756
     we can build more and      
 more complicated applications. 
 就可以制作出越来越复杂的应用。

1584
01:10:01,758 --> 01:10:07,561
 So, an example of this is, you 
 might have your calendar app,  
 例如，你可能有一个日历应用，

1585
01:10:07,563 --> 01:10:09,930
      and it's showing you      
        the entire year.        
        它展示给你一整年的信息。

1586
01:10:09,932 --> 01:10:12,599
 And you click on a month, and  
 now it shows you a month view. 
 随后你点击了一个月份，于是它展示给你月视图。

1587
01:10:12,601 --> 01:10:14,567
 Well, a month view looks a lot 
  different than a year view.   
  月视图看起来和年视图就不太一样了。

1588
01:10:14,569 --> 01:10:17,503
   A month view just has all    
 the days and maybe some circle 
 一个月视图只含有所有的日期，也许在日期上

1589
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:19,204
 that tells you where you have  
    an appointment on a day.    
    会有一些通知你在某天会有任务的圈圈。

1590
01:10:19,206 --> 01:10:20,939
       And then when you        
      click on a day, and    
      随后，你点击了一天，然后你   

1591
01:10:20,941 --> 01:10:23,074
 now you get a day view, okay?  
 获得了一个日视图

1592
01:10:23,076 --> 01:10:25,043
   And the day is showing you   
     the hours and what all     
     日视图会显示小时信息和这天你的所有

1593
01:10:25,045 --> 01:10:27,611
 your appointments are, and you 
  click on the Appointment now  
  任务，随后你点击了任务，

1594
01:10:27,613 --> 01:10:29,947
  you get an appointment view   
  and it showing the detail of  
你会获得任务视图，它会显示任务的细节，

1595
01:10:29,949 --> 01:10:32,182
     where you're going and     
  when it is et cetera, okay?  
  将要去哪，何时动身还有其它一些东西

1596
01:10:32,184 --> 01:10:36,452
   Well, each of those views,   
 year view, month view, the day 
 这些view中的每一个，年视图，月视图，日视图，

1597
01:10:36,454 --> 01:10:40,155
   view, and the appointment    
    view are their own MVCs.    
    任务视图，都有他们自己的MVC。

1598
01:10:40,157 --> 01:10:41,857
             Okay?           

1599
01:10:41,858 --> 01:10:43,558
      But you can see how       
     the last three, okay,      
     但是你可以发现，最后三个view,

1600
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:47,628
   are used as essentially a    
 minion of the top level view,
 都被最顶层的年视图为了展示更多的细节

1601
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:51,032
           year view,           
   to show more detail, okay?   
   而被当做仆人使用。

1602
01:10:51,034 --> 01:10:52,766
       So the year view,        
     you click on a month,      
     所以在年视图里，你点击了一个月份，

1603
01:10:52,768 --> 01:10:57,404
  it's going to use the month   
 view MVC to show more detail.  
 它会利用月份视图的MVC来展现更多细节。

1604
01:10:57,406 --> 01:11:00,406
   So it's part of its view,    
             okay?              
    所以它是它视图的一部分，

1605
01:11:00,408 --> 01:11:03,476
     So, you see this also      
      in iOS with tab bar  
所以你也在带有便签控制栏的iOS应用

1606
01:11:03,478 --> 01:11:05,228
      controllers, right?       
      中见过这些吧

1607
01:11:05,229 --> 01:11:06,979
    You have the tab bar at     
   the bottom, I have four or   
   在底部有一个标签栏，有四个或五个

1608
01:11:06,981 --> 01:11:09,615
  five things you can choose.  
  项可以供你选择。 

1609
01:11:09,616 --> 01:11:12,250
  Well there's some MVC at the  
 top whose has four pointers to 
 在上面有一个MVC，它指向四个仆人，

1610
01:11:12,252 --> 01:11:15,120
  four minions, which are the   
 four MVCs that are each going  
也就是将要出现在标签栏中的MVC，

1611
01:11:15,122 --> 01:11:17,488
 to appear in a tab bar, okay?  

1612
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:18,673
    We'll be doing that for    
    我们将会做一个这方面的例子， 

1613
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:19,857
     example, in assignment     
         number two or     
      在第二次或第三次作业，我们会        

1614
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:21,792
      three where we'll be      
      making a tab bar and   
      制作一个标签栏，   

1615
01:11:21,794 --> 01:11:25,328
    you're gonna have to do     
      multiple MVCs, okay?      
      你们将会学习如何使用多个MVC

1616
01:11:25,330 --> 01:11:28,531
   So, that basically results   
    in a picture looks kinda    
  所以使用多个MVC的效果看起来就像

1617
01:11:28,533 --> 01:11:29,899
           like this.       
           这张图片一样。    

1618
01:11:29,901 --> 01:11:31,434
           All right?           

1619
01:11:31,435 --> 01:11:32,968
  Where you got this MVC, and   
  在你看到的这个MVC里，

1620
01:11:32,969 --> 01:11:34,502
 you see the purple one that's  
    like underneath the word    
    找到'together'下面的那个

1621
01:11:34,505 --> 01:11:37,239
      together there, and 
      紫色的，      

1622
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,974
 it points to three other MVCs  
   outside of its view thing.   
   它从view指向了另外三个MVC，

1623
01:11:39,977 --> 01:11:40,542
             Okay?

1624
01:11:41,478 --> 01:11:42,710
        That's how we're        
     going to build it, so      
     这就是我们创建标签栏控制器的方式，

1625
01:11:42,712 --> 01:11:43,944
      that might be a tab       
        bar control and     
      这些可能就是它的

1626
01:11:43,946 --> 01:11:45,812
 those might be the three tabs. 
三个标签。

1627
01:11:45,814 --> 01:11:47,614
           Okay, and            
 each one is its own little MVC 
 并且它们每一个都是

1628
01:11:47,616 --> 01:11:50,249
    completely independent,     
      operates on its own.      
      完全独立的，可以独自行动的小MVC。

1629
01:11:50,251 --> 01:11:52,418
       Doesn't even know,       
      这时它就是一个

1630
01:11:52,419 --> 01:11:54,586
  it's a generic reusable view  
   like thing at this point.    
普通的可重用的view之类的东西，

1631
01:11:54,589 --> 01:11:56,689
     Doesn't even know that     
       it's in a tab bar.  
       它甚至不知道它在标签栏中。

1632
01:11:56,691 --> 01:11:58,090
    Okay, it just knows that    
      it's supposed to do   
      它只知道它应该做

1633
01:11:58,092 --> 01:11:59,591
       whatever it does.        
       这些事情。

1634
01:11:59,593 --> 01:12:01,192
             And so             
   it's modular in that way.    
   所以在这方面，它是模块化的。

1635
01:12:01,194 --> 01:12:04,328
 You can also see that there's  
  no communication between any 
  可以看到这里不再有其他箭头， 

1636
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:06,397
    other, there's no other     
       arrows, except for
       除了一些模型。       

1637
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:08,249
      some of the models.       

1638
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,100
 You see some of the models are 
 communicating with each other. 
 某些模型之间在互相通信。

1639
01:12:10,102 --> 01:12:11,852
         You know a big         
         要知道，

1640
01:12:11,853 --> 01:12:13,603
     application might have     
     a single shared model.     
     一个大型的应用也许会有一个单独的共享模型。

1641
01:12:13,605 --> 01:12:17,606
  Or the models might be split  
 off into pieces to be used by  
 或者，模型会被分开来供子MVC使用。

1642
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:20,208
           sub MVCs.            

1643
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,326
             Okay?              
              But          
              但是，     

1644
01:12:21,327 --> 01:12:22,443
    that's the only kind of     
 communication you have there.  
 这里只能使用这种通信方式。

1645
01:12:22,446 --> 01:12:23,678
   All other communication is   
   其它所有的通信

1646
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,681
   either the structure view    
  communication we saw on MVC,  
  要么是MVC中的结构化通信，

1647
01:12:26,683 --> 01:12:29,716
   or it's using MVCs as part   
  of the view of another MVC.   
  要么是将MVC用作另一个MVC视图的一部分。

1648
01:12:31,386 --> 01:12:32,385
    Any question about that?    
    有问题吗？

1649
01:12:33,688 --> 01:12:36,689
  So we definitely don't want   
   to be having designs that    
   所以我们当然不希望设计成这样，

1650
01:12:36,691 --> 01:12:38,190
     look like this, okay?  

1651
01:12:38,192 --> 01:12:39,824
       Where everybody's        
     talking to everybody.      
     所有都在互相通信，

1652
01:12:39,826 --> 01:12:41,459
      We can't tell who's       
        talking to what.        
        我们不能分清谁在和什么通信。

1653
01:12:41,461 --> 01:12:43,994
 It's just impossible to debug  
    a program like this, and   
    这会让调试程序变得异常艰难， 

1654
01:12:43,996 --> 01:12:45,446
       it doesn't scale.
       而且它无法规模化。        

1655
01:12:45,447 --> 01:12:46,897
     You can't build really     
     big programs this way.     
     你不能通过这种方式创建出大程序。

1656
01:12:46,899 --> 01:12:48,165
 It just becomes impossible to 
 这样的话， 

1657
01:12:48,167 --> 01:12:51,634
   know how touching anything   
 would break everything, right? 
 你无法弄清楚，什么地方会引发整个程序的崩溃。

1658
01:12:51,636 --> 01:12:53,469
    So we're definitely not     
    going to be doing that.     
    所以我们绝对不会这样做的。

1659
01:12:54,639 --> 01:12:57,573
  All right so that's MVC and,  
  所以，这就是MVC，

1660
01:12:57,575 --> 01:13:00,875
  like I say, on Monday we'll   
  apply MVC to our calculator.  
  我们将会在周一的课里把MVC应用到我们的计算器程序中。

1661
01:13:01,845 --> 01:13:02,977
      So what's coming up?      
      所以，接下来是什么？

1662
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:06,146
     I always try to get to     
   this slide every lecture.  
   我每节课都尽量讲到这里，

1663
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:09,716
     Sometimes I forget but     
   it's posted in the slides.   
   有时我会忘记，但是它被放到了课件中。

1664
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:12,018
  It says tomorrow is Friday.   
  周五也就是明天，

1665
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,320
         No, day after          
      tomorrow is Friday.       
      不对，后天的周五，

1666
01:13:14,322 --> 01:13:17,256
         And people who         
   are watching on iTunes U,    
   在iTunes U上观看的同学们，

1667
01:13:17,258 --> 01:13:19,858
   these Friday sections will   
     not be on iTunes U so      
     周五的部分不会被放到iTunes U上，

1668
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:22,461
      don't go looking for      
  them only the normal Monday,
  只有周一和周三的课件才会被放上去，  

1669
01:13:22,463 --> 01:13:24,596
       Wednesday lectures       
       went on iTunes U.      
       所以不要到处找。  

1670
01:13:25,999 --> 01:13:27,164
  But, for Stanford students,   
  但是对于在坐的同学，

1671
01:13:27,166 --> 01:13:30,300
  Friday we have this debugger  
    section we talked about.    
    周五我们将讨论之前谈到的调试部分。

1672
01:13:30,302 --> 01:13:32,769
     And then next Monday,      
     下周一，你们的阅读作业

1673
01:13:32,771 --> 01:13:35,638
    your reading assignment     
        is gonna be due.        
        将会截至。
