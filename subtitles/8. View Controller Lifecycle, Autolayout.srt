Stanford University.
斯坦福大学

3
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:11,275
Okay, well, welcome to Lecture 8 of
好的，欢迎来到2015年冬季学期 

4
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:14,812
Stanford CS193P winter of 2015.
 CS193P 的课程

5
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:18,348
Today we have two major topics we're gonna talk about,
今天我们会讲到两个主要的话题

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,584
one is view controller life cycle which is your view
一个是 View Controller 的生命周期

7
00:00:21,586 --> 00:00:23,119
controller gets born.
也就是 View Controller 从产生

8
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:25,021
It lives and does a lot of things and
然后完成了一系列的操作

9
00:00:25,023 --> 00:00:27,856
then it dies and so you want to be able to find out about
到 View Controller 死亡，你希望能够知道

10
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:30,392
all those things that are going on and you can.
这些生命周期中，什么事情正在发生，你能在其中做什么

11
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:32,627
I'm gonna have a brief demo about that and
这里我会有一个简单的关于生命周期的 Demo

12
00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:34,762
then we're gonna go into auto layout and
接着我们涉及 Auto Layout 的内容

13
00:00:34,764 --> 00:00:37,331
I keep promising we're gonna talk about it, so
我保证我们会在这节课中讲到它

14
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,967
I am gonna finally talk about auto layout.
但是我打算最后再讲 Auto Layout

15
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:42,002
Of course you all ready know a lot about auto layout and
当然，你已经知道一点点 Auto Layout 的知识了

16
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:43,987
I'm gonna review that.
我们在今天的课程中会先回顾它们

17
00:00:43,988 --> 00:00:45,971
Then we're gonna talk about an important piece of auto
然后，我们会讲一讲 Auto Layout 中一个比较重要的部分

18
00:00:45,974 --> 00:00:50,343
layout that we haven't talked so far which is size classes,
我们从未涉及到的 Size Classes

19
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:53,078
and then I'll be doing a humongous couple of
这里，我会做一系列的 Demo

20
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,181
demos on auto lab because, you know, it's the kind of thing
来帮助你理解 Auto Layout，你知道，真正看过的东西

21
00:00:56,183 --> 00:00:59,918
you're going to have to see it to really understand it, but
才是最容易理解的

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,453
first, let's talk about view controller life cycle.
但是首先，我们先讲一下 View Controller 的生命周期

23
00:01:03,723 --> 00:01:06,090
When we refer to the view controller life cycle,
当我们谈到 View Controller 的生命周期的时候

24
00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:07,691
we're just talking about a sequence of
我们讲的是，在这个 View Controller 的生命周期中

25
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:11,261
messages that is sent to your view controller as it
一系列发送至它的消息

26
00:01:11,263 --> 00:01:12,929
progresses through its lifetime.
这些消息伴随着整个的生命周期

27
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:16,231
Why do we care about this?
我们可能会问，为什么我要关心这个？

28
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:18,967
Well because you very commonly wanna override these
那是因为，你们通常会在你们的子类中覆写这些

29
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:20,935
messages that are sent to the view controller in
发送给 View Controller 的消息

30
00:01:20,937 --> 00:01:23,871
your subclass to find out what's going on, because you
来知道，你的应用正在干什么

31
00:01:23,873 --> 00:01:26,140
might need to do things, make certain decisions or
因为你可能希望做一些决定或者其他的操作

32
00:01:26,142 --> 00:01:29,343
whatever at certain points in your view controller life
在你的 View Controller 生命周期的某个特定的时刻

33
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:32,846
cycle, so let's talk about the cycle and how it goes.
所以，让我们来讲一下 View Controller 的生命周期以及它如何工作的

34
00:01:32,848 --> 00:01:34,881
It starts off with creation.
生命周期由创建一个 View Controller 开始

35
00:01:34,883 --> 00:01:39,352
99% of the time, this is from a storyboard, all right.
99%的情况下，它是从 Storyboard 中创建的

36
00:01:39,354 --> 00:01:41,987
As you know, you create these scenes in the storyboard.
你所知道的，你可以在 Storyboard 中创建这些场景

37
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:44,856
Those scenes have a view controller class associated
这些场景会关联一个 View Controller 的类

38
00:01:44,858 --> 00:01:48,493
with them and you're just, you're segueing to an MVC,
并且，你 segue 到一个 MVC

39
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:52,897
even if you create an MVC in code, which I don't even talk
甚至是你通过代码来创建一个 MVC 的

40
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:54,732
about how to do, maybe we'll talk about it a little later
虽然我目前还没有讲到如何通过代码来创建，不过可能之后会讲到

41
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:56,433
in the quarter, but could look up in the documentation,
不过你还是可以通过查找文档来获取这些方法

42
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:58,218
it's quite easy.
挺容易的

43
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,002
Even in that case, you're going to instantiate a view
就在这样的情况下，你将会使用一个标识符（identifier）

44
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:03,006
controller using identifier in the storyboard, okay, and
在 Storyboard 中去初始化一个 View Controller

45
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:04,707
that's how you're gonna get the view controller,
那就是你如何得到 View Controller 的

46
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:07,643
so creation is all most always from the storyboard, and
所以，大多数情况下，是通过 Storyboard 创建 View Controller 的

47
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:10,479
there is an init that gets called, it's kind of a weird
并且，有一个 init 方法被调用，但是是一个挺奇怪的 init 方法

48
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:12,847
init, initWithCoder, I'm not gonna talk about it too much,
initWithCoder: ，我不打算花时间讲这个方法

49
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:15,283
I mentioned it a little bit in the reading assignment,
我会在阅读作业中涉及一点点

50
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:16,784
number one or number two.
好像是作业 No.1 或者 No.2

51
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:20,654
I don't remember, so there is an init but we try to stay
我不记得了，所以，这里有一个 init

52
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:23,223
away from init so if we can, if they're somewhere else, and
但是我们尽可能不去调用 init，有其他的初始化方法

53
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:25,492
in the view control life cycle there's a lot of
在 View Controller 的生命周期里，你可以看到一大堆

54
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:28,995
somewhere else's to initialize things besides in init, so
除了 init 之外的其他的初始化方法

55
00:02:28,997 --> 00:02:32,698
I'm not even gonna talk about the init right here.
所以我现在并不打算涉及到 init

56
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,100
Okay, what happens after that initialization though?
好的，初始化之后会发生什么呢？

57
00:02:35,102 --> 00:02:36,468
Well, the first thing is,
第一个发生的事情是

58
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,638
you get prepared if you're being segued to, all right,
如果你被 segue 到这个 View Controller 的话，那么你会准备好（get prepared）

59
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,575
the next thing is your outlets are gonna get set, 'kay.
另外一个发生的事情是，你的 outlets 都被设置好了，明白了吗？

60
00:02:44,577 --> 00:02:47,444
It's just we're gonna wire up all those at sign IV outlets
就是那些我们与 IBOutlet 链接的东西

61
00:02:47,446 --> 00:02:50,747
that you have, and then your view controller's gonna
接下来，你的 View Controller 会显示在屏幕上

62
00:02:50,749 --> 00:02:53,316
appear on screen and then it might disappear and
接着消失在屏幕上

63
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:56,486
then might reappear and then disappear, okay, and
之后可能又显示在屏幕上，再次消失

64
00:02:56,488 --> 00:02:59,155
its geometry might change because of auto rotation or
而且，它的几何位置（geometry）可能因为自动旋转

65
00:02:59,157 --> 00:03:02,991
something else happens and changes the geometry review,
或者发生一些其他的事情导致了几何位置的改变

66
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:04,292
so that's happening.
这就是发生的东西

67
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:06,494
And then in obscure cases,
在一些复杂的情况下

68
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:09,296
you might have a low memory situation on your device and
你可能会遇到一个设备可用内容低的一个情况

69
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:13,367
the system might try to get you involved to resolve that,
系统可能尝试让你解决这个问题

70
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:15,402
and we'll talk about that briefly, all right, so
我们会简单地讲讲这个，好的

71
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,104
that's the cycle.
这就是 View Controller 的生命周期

72
00:03:17,105 --> 00:03:18,805
So what are these methods that are involved in that cycle?
在生命周期中，会有哪些方法涉及到呢？

73
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:22,408
Well you know about the preparation that's prepared
你知道的，preparedForSegue 做了准备工作

74
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,044
for segue and some other MVC that's what prepares you,
一些其他的 MVC 准备你

75
00:03:25,046 --> 00:03:28,047
and you know about outlet setting, right, just
并且，你知道 outlet 设置

76
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:30,549
system automatically sets your outlook from your storyboard.
即系统自动从 Storyboard 中设置了你的 outlet

77
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:32,550
So the next thing that happens is loading,
接下去发生的事情，就是载入（loading）

78
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:35,720
as your view gets load, well we call that outlet setting,
你的视图被载入。在这之前设置了 outlet

79
00:03:35,722 --> 00:03:39,023
the loading process, and when it's done loading it sends you
接着进入载入的过程，当完成载入的时候

80
00:03:39,025 --> 00:03:40,924
this message viewDidLoad.
它会发送一个 viewDidLoad 的消息

81
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:43,760
ViewDidLoad is an exceptionally good place to
viewDidLoad 是一个非常好的地方

82
00:03:43,762 --> 00:03:47,297
put stuff to initialize your view, why is it so good?
去放置你初始化你的视图的代码，为什么？

83
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:51,634
Because you're prepared by whoever's segueing to you, and
那是因为，你，View Controller，已经由 segue 到你的对象准备好了

84
00:03:51,636 --> 00:03:54,970
your outlets are all set, 'kay, so you're in
而且你的 outlet 也被设置完成了

85
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:57,706
great shape to go do things to initialize your view,
你处于一个初始化你的视图操作的最佳时机

86
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,343
cuz you are all kinda set up and ready to go.
因为你需要的设置已经都设置完了，你已经准备做接下来的操作了

87
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:03,644
Now, when you override viewDidLoad, it's important to
现在，如果你覆写了 viewDidLoad 方法

88
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:06,147
call super.viewDidLoad and in fact in
一件很重要的事情就是，别忘了调用 super.viewDidLoad

89
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:09,249
all these life cycle methods you always wanna call super.
而且在 View Controller 中所有生命周期相关的方法中，你始终希望调用 super 的相应方法

90
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:10,817
You can either call it at the beginning or at the end,
你可以在方法的开头或者结尾调用 super.viewDidLoad

91
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,586
kind of up to you, doesn't really matter usually but
这个你自己来决定，通常不会有太大的关系

92
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:16,289
you definitely want to let super have a chance to do it,
但是，你希望 super 有机会去做它的事情

93
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,457
'kay, so don't forget about that.
所以，千万不要忘了

94
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,095
Now one thing that you often wanna do in vewDidLoad is
通常你在 viewDidLoad 里做的一件事情是

95
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,729
update your UI, okay?
更新你的用户界面，明白了吗？

96
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,765
Now you're gonna be updating your UI in the property
之前我们说过，一旦你的模型发生了改变

97
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,035
observers of all your things that change the model, and
你会在模型的属性观察器（property observer）中更新用户界面

98
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,804
you should continue to do that because your view
你应该继续去做这个操作，因为你的 View Controller

99
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,440
control might be on screen all ready loaded,
已经被载入，也显示在屏幕上了

100
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,576
someone changes the model, you gotta update the UI.
有些人改变了模型，你必须更新你的用户界面

101
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:42,178
But when you're first having your thing created and
但是，当你刚创建了一个 View Controller 的时候

102
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,313
you want to update your UI, it's kind of,
你同样需要更新你的用户界面

103
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:47,149
you know, your property observer's in your model, and
那是因为，你的在模型中的属性观察器

104
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:50,152
aren't really updating the UI because your outlets aren't
并不会在 outlet 设置之前去真正更新你的用户界面

105
00:04:50,154 --> 00:04:52,354
set maybe because you're in the prepare for
因为你在 preparedForSegue 的过程中

106
00:04:52,356 --> 00:04:53,688
segue phase right?
对吗？

107
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,956
So a lot of times, you get to viewDidLoad and
所以，很多时候，当 View Controller 被调用 viewDidLoad 的时候

108
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,059
you haven't really been able to update your UI because your
用户界面并没有真正被更新，因为你的

109
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:00,660
outlets haven't been set, so
outlet 在这之前还没有被设置好

110
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:03,430
viewDidLoad is a great place to then update your UI.
所以，viewDidLoad 是一个更新用户界面的好时候

111
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:07,033
So if you factor out updating UI into a separate method like
如果你重构了用户界面的代码并将其分离一些其他的代码

112
00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:09,502
we did in the demo called update UI, but
比如我们在 Demo 中称之为 updateUI 的方法

113
00:05:09,504 --> 00:05:11,637
you can call whatever you want, or
但是，你可以调用任何你想要调用的方法

114
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,273
you can even have a couple different UI updating methods,
或者是，你还可以有一些不同的更新用户界面的方法

115
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:18,677
calling those in viewDidLoad is very common, 'kay,
在 viewDidLoad 里调用它们是很常见的方法

116
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:22,313
cuz your view is ready to be updated, however, you have to
需要注意的是，虽然你的视图准备被更新

117
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:26,183
be careful here because your geometry is not yet set, 'kay?
但是，你的几何位置还没有被设置，好吗？

118
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:27,517
You only get loaded once,
你只会被载入一次

119
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,753
when you first come out of the storyboard and
也就是从 Storyboard 中出来

120
00:05:29,755 --> 00:05:31,921
you get prepared, your outlets gets set,
准备就绪，outlet 设置完毕

121
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:33,756
you get viewDidLoad, that's it.
你被调用了 viewDidLoad，仅此一次

122
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:37,059
That only happens once in the lifetime of a view controller,
一个 View Controller 的生命周期中只会有一次

123
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:39,661
but your geometry, like what your bounds are,
但是你的几何位置，也就是你的边界

124
00:05:39,663 --> 00:05:41,096
that has not been set yet,
在这个时刻还没有被设置

125
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:44,332
that's not gonna be set till later in its lifetime, okay?
在这个 View Controller 生命周期的较晚的时候，它才会被设置，明白了吗？

126
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:47,702
So do not do, I should have put this in red, do not put,
所以，不要，我这里把它标记成了红色

127
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:51,005
do geometry related things in viewDidLoad, 'kay,
不要在 viewDidLoad 里做与几何位置相关的操作

128
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:54,374
you can do almost everything else in viewDidLoad, but
除此之外，你可以做几乎其他的任何操作

129
00:05:54,376 --> 00:05:57,877
do not do that, 'kay, and we'll talk about where you do
唯独这个不行，你可能会问什么时候才可以做几何位置相关的操作呢？

130
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:01,180
do those things in a moment here, all right.
我们稍后会讲到

131
00:06:01,182 --> 00:06:04,517
Next one in the life cycle is viewWillAppear,
下一个在生命周期中被调用的方法是 viewWillAppear

132
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:07,386
'kay, so that's sent to you right before you're going to
当你的 View Controller 马上要显示在屏幕上的时候

133
00:06:07,388 --> 00:06:08,854
appear on screen.
它会被调用

134
00:06:08,856 --> 00:06:10,889
Now, that could be right after viewDidLoad or
这有可能在 viewDidLoad 之后直接被调用

135
00:06:10,891 --> 00:06:12,623
it could be a long time after viewDidLoad.
或者也有可能在 viewDidLoad 之后，过一会儿才被调用

136
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,192
It depends on what's going on in your UI,
这个依赖于你用户界面上做的操作

137
00:06:15,194 --> 00:06:17,995
okay, and viewWillAppear gets an argument, which is
好的，viewWillAppear 会有一个参数

138
00:06:17,997 --> 00:06:20,831
whether it's an animated appearance or not, 'kay?
这个参数表示这个 View Controller 的出现是否有动画效果的

139
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,966
Usually you don't care about that.
通常你不需要关心这个参数

140
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:24,734
And when would your appearance be animated?
什么时候需要你的 View Controller 的出现带有动画效果呢？

141
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:27,069
Well you're in a navigation controller and
当你在一个 Navigation Controller 里

142
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,471
someone presses to segue you on screen,
什么东西出发了 segue 到你的 View Controller 的时候

143
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,207
you'll slide in, that's the animation, okay?
那么你会通过滑入的方式显示出来，这就是动画效果，明白了吗？

144
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:35,743
So, viewWillAppear,
好的，viewWillAppear

145
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:38,812
this could happen all the time, this could happen
这可以在你的 View Controller 的整个生命周期里多次被调用

146
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:40,981
repeatedly in the lifetime of your view controller,

147
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,416
cuz your view controller can come on screen or go off.
因为你的 View Controller 能显示在屏幕上，也能从屏幕上消失

148
00:06:43,418 --> 00:06:45,651
Let's think of an example, split view,
让我们设想一个情况，Split View

149
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:47,586
the master of a split view.
Split View 的 Master

150
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:50,522
When you first bring up your iPad user interface,
当你第一次打开 iPad 的用户界面时候

151
00:06:50,524 --> 00:06:52,524
it's in portrait, you don't see the master,
它是在竖屏模式（portrait）的，你不会看到 Master

152
00:06:52,526 --> 00:06:54,659
you have to kind of slide it out to see the master,
你必须通过滑动来显示 Master

153
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:57,462
you only see the detail, right, so it's not visible.
这种情况下，你只能看到 Detail，Master 是不可见的

154
00:06:57,464 --> 00:07:00,564
You rotate to landscape, now the master becomes visible, so
但是，当你旋转你的设备到横屏模式（landscape）的时候，那么 Master 就变的可见了

155
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:02,066
you're gonna get viewWillAppear.
这时候 viewWillAppear 会被调用

156
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:05,902
You rotate back to portrait, it's off screen.
当你又旋转回竖屏模式的时候，Master 从屏幕上消失了

157
00:07:05,904 --> 00:07:07,904
You rotate back to landscape, it's gonna appear again,
然后你又旋转到横屏模式，又显示了

158
00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:09,706
it's gonna send you viewWillAppear again.
viewWillAppear 又会被调用

159
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,475
So you're gonna get viewWillAppear every time it
所以，每一次 Master 显示在屏幕上的时候

160
00:07:12,477 --> 00:07:14,477
appears on screen,
viewWillAppear 都会被调用

161
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:16,478
'kay, now what would you do when a viewWillAppear?
那么在 viewWillAppear 中，你能够做些什么呢？

162
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,014
A lot of times maybe, if you have to do something very
可能通常的情况下，如果你需要做一些费时间的事情

163
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:21,282
expensive, like let's say you have to go out to the network
比如你到网络上去获取什么东西

164
00:07:21,284 --> 00:07:24,118
to get something, an image or something like that,
一个图片或者其他的

165
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,121
you might not want to do that in viewDidLoad because maybe
你不想让这些代码在 viewDidLoad 中允许因为

166
00:07:27,123 --> 00:07:30,057
the user never turns view to landscape and never looks at
用户可能从来不会将屏幕横过来

167
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:32,426
your master, maybe you've got an app where the details all
从来不会看你的 Master，用户只关心 Detail 中的内容

168
00:07:32,428 --> 00:07:34,894
are that matters and people rarely pull out the master.
很少用户会拉出 Master 来看

169
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:36,646
Well, you wouldn't wanna do
那么，你不想每一次都调用这些花时间的代码

170
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:38,397
that expensive thing until the master actually appeared.
只有当 Master 真正要显示的时候你才希望调用这些代码

171
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,633
Now, you're gonna wanna do that expensive thing in
而且， 通常你希望能够将这些花时间的代码

172
00:07:40,635 --> 00:07:42,401
another thread, we'll talk about it on
跑在另外一个线程中，这个我们周三会提到

173
00:07:42,403 --> 00:07:44,236
Wednesday to keep the main thread active.
如何保持主线程不被阻塞

174
00:07:44,238 --> 00:07:46,438
And, of course, when that master appeared, if
而且，如果当 Master 显示的时候

175
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,140
you're waiting for something on the network there's gonna
如果你在等待网络上的数据返回

176
00:07:49,142 --> 00:07:51,642
be a blank space or something that we'll fill in later,
Master 会是一片空白，或者是一些我们稍后会填充的东西

177
00:07:51,644 --> 00:07:54,078
maybe you put a spinning wheel, things like that, but
或许你会放置一个 Loading 的滚轮，或者其他的东西

178
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,780
viewWillAppear since you know you're actually gonna get on
viewWillAppear 已经知道，你要放置在屏幕上的东西可能要花一点点时间

179
00:07:56,782 --> 00:07:59,149
screen is a place we might kick off something that's
你目前放置的是一个替代物，之后会被替换

180
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:01,718
a little bit expensive, also your geometry is set here.
同时你的几何位置也被设置好了

181
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,987
Okay, by the time you get view will appear your bounds,
所以，当 viewWillAppear 被调用的时候

182
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:08,424
your view's bounds, you're a view controller right, so
你视图的边界，还记得你是一个 View Controller 吧？

183
00:08:08,426 --> 00:08:11,059
your view's bound, view.bound is set, so
你视图的边界，view.bound 已经设置好了

184
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:13,061
you can do geometry stuff here.
那么你可以在这里做一些几何位置相关的代码

185
00:08:13,063 --> 00:08:16,597
It's legal and you might want to, 'kay, but
这是完全没有问题的，也正是你希望的

186
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:19,266
I'm gonna show you another place you can do that as well
但是，在后面几个 Slide 中，我想给你们展示一个另外的地方

187
00:08:19,268 --> 00:08:21,335
on the next couple slides.
同样你可以做一些几何位置相关的代码

188
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:24,804
There's also a viewDidAppear in addition to viewWillAppear,
除了 viewWillAppear 之外，还有一个 viewDidAppear

189
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:26,072
'kay, so
好的

190
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:29,208
viewDidAppear gets sent to you after you are now on screen.
当你已经显示在屏幕上之后，viewDidAppear 被调用

191
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,912
You are visible now, 'kay, pretty straightforward, and
此时你是可见的，明白了吗？很明显易懂

192
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,681
similarly there's viewWillDisappear, so
同样的，与这两个方法相对，有 viewWillDeisappear

193
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,416
you're just about to be taken off screen.
你正要从屏幕上消失的时候被调用

194
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:41,352
Again, you're the split view master in landscape,
我们接着上面举的例子，你是横屏模式中 Split View 中的 Master

195
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,320
the person rotates the portrait, you're gonna
如果用户旋转到了竖屏模式，那么

196
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,790
get viewWillDisappear cuz you're going to disappear,
你的 View Controller 会被调用 viewWillDisappear 方法，因为 Master 视图从屏幕上消失了

197
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:50,794
it's just going to show only the detail, 'kay?
随后，屏幕上只会显示 Detail，明白了吗？

198
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:54,864
Here you might clean up some stuff, you might get rid of
这里你可以做一些清理的操作，你可能会

199
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:57,867
some resources that are expensive, like a big image or
清除一些占用资源的对象，类似于一副大图

200
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:00,135
something that you can reconstitute fairly quickly,
或者其他你能够快速

201
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:02,170
maybe from disk or something.
从磁盘中恢复的东西

202
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:03,605
That's the kind of thing you'll do in
这就是你要在 viewWillDisappear 中做的，当然

203
00:09:03,606 --> 00:09:05,039
viewWillDisappear, and of course, there's a did version
同样的，viewWillDisappear 也有一个 did 版本

204
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:11,178
of this too, viewDidDisappear, 'kay, so that will disappear,
viewDidDisappear，明白了吗？

205
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,048
will appear and will disappear in their dids, okay?
willAppear 和 willDisappear 的 did 形态

206
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,317
Now let's talk about geometry.
接下来，让我们讲一下几何位置

207
00:09:16,318 --> 00:09:18,585
So when your geometry changes, when your bounds change,
当你几何位置有所变化时，你的边界同样发生了变化

208
00:09:18,587 --> 00:09:21,521
the system knows that your bounds changed, and
系统知道你的边界改变了，而且

209
00:09:21,523 --> 00:09:24,891
it knows that you probably have to re-layout your user
他知道，你大概需要重新布局你的用户界面

210
00:09:24,893 --> 00:09:26,158
interface, okay?

211
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,728
Now 99% of the time, that's gonna happen by magic because
所以，99%的情况下，重新布局是自动完成的

212
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,798
you've set up your auto layout properly, right, so
因为你已经设置好了 Auto Layout 属性

213
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,467
you don't even have to do anything, but if for
所以你甚至不需要去做其他的事情

214
00:09:35,469 --> 00:09:37,802
some reason you wanted to do something,
但是鉴于某些原因，你可能想在这个过程中做什么的话

215
00:09:37,804 --> 00:09:40,271
you can override one of these two methods,
你可以覆写两个方法中的一个

216
00:09:40,273 --> 00:09:43,574
viewWillLayoutSubviews and viewDidLayoutSubviews,
viewWillLayoutSubviews 和 viewDidLayoutSubviews

217
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:46,643
so the system calls viewWillLayoutSubviews anytime
然后系统会在它认为合适的时候去调用 viewWillLayoutSubviews

218
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:48,445
it wants to,

219
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:50,246
make sure that your views are properly laid out.
确保你的视图被正确布局

220
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:54,550
Now, when it calls, this is not viewsBoundsDidChange,
现在，当它调用的时候，注意这个方法名字不是 viewsBoundsDidChange

221
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,818
that's not the name of this method,
这不是这个方法的名字

222
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,620
okay, it's a viewWillLayoutSubviews, so
这个方法名字是 viewWillLayoutSubviews

223
00:09:58,622 --> 00:10:01,523
your subviews can get laid out for lots of different reasons,
你的子视图会因为多种原因被重新布局

224
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:04,325
maybe one of your subviews changes in a way that causes
可能你视图中的一个发生了改变

225
00:10:04,327 --> 00:10:07,762
it to change shape and has to be relaid out, et cetera.
比如它的形状发生了改变，整个视图需要重新布局，或者其他类似的情况

226
00:10:07,764 --> 00:10:10,497
So, viewWillLayoutSubviews is sent to
所以，当你的视图层次或者你的顶层视图的边界发生改变的时候

227
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:13,400
you when someone inside your
你会收到 viewWillLayoutSubviews 的消息

228
00:10:13,402 --> 00:10:17,037
view hierarchy or your top level bounds change in a way

229
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,840
where the system needs you to layout your subviews, okay?
因为系统需要你去重新布局你的子视图，明白了吗？

230
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:23,576
Now, you can make this happen by calling, just like you
你可以通过通过调用来实现这个

231
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:26,478
have set needs display you can say set needs layout.
就像你设置 setNeedsDisplay 那样，setNeedsLayout

232
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,715
You say set needs layout, then the next pass around the event
当你调用了 setNeedsLayout 之后，在下一轮的 Event Loop 中

233
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:35,286
loop, the system will re-layout your subviews, 'kay.
系统会重新布局你的子视图，明白了吗？

234
00:10:35,288 --> 00:10:38,288
Now this can be called, quite often this viewWill and
viewWillLayoutSubviews 和 viewDidLayoutSubviews

235
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:42,092
DidLayoutSubviews because changes are being made all
经常被调用，因为无时无刻都会发生变化

236
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:44,061
the time and the system doesn't
系统并不是始终都知道

237
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:46,029
always quite know whether that affected your subview, so
是否某个操作影响了你的子视图

238
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:48,898
it might ask you to just lay them out again, okay?
所以它可能会让你重新来对子视图布局，明白了吗？

239
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,101
So don't be surprised when you get viewWillLayoutSubviews two
所以，当你的边界改动了一次

240
00:10:52,103 --> 00:10:55,203
or three times when the bounds only changed once, let's say,
但是你的 viewWillLayoutSubviews 方法被调用了两次或者三次的时候，不要觉得惊讶

241
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:56,438
'kay, and you have to,
而且，你需要

242
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,040
if you're gonna do something in these two methods,
如果你在这两个方法中做了什么的话

243
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:01,108
you're gonna have to do the right thing,
你必须做的对

244
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,711
even if like your bounds don't actually change.
甚至是，你的边界并没有真正改变的情况下

245
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:07,447
This whole process of laying out your subviews,
整个布局你子视图的过程

246
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:10,717
the idea is to make sure that your subviews
唯一的想法就是，确保你的子视图是

247
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,185
are properly laid out.
正确被布局的

248
00:11:13,187 --> 00:11:16,655
Now again, most of that's happening with auto layout,
在一次重申，大多数布局都可以通过 Auto Layout 来做到

249
00:11:16,657 --> 00:11:19,958
and the auto layout happens between these two methods, so
Auto Layout 在这两个方法之间起作用

250
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,361
you get view a layout subviews, you do whatever you
首先是 viewWillLayoutSubviews，接着做任何你想做的

251
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:26,264
wanna do, then auto layout happens, then you get
然后，Auto Layout 起作用

252
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:29,200
viewDidLayoutSubviews, 'kay, so your subviews might have
接下来，viewDidLayoutSubviews，好的

253
00:11:29,202 --> 00:11:33,136
moved around between the two calls of these, make sense?
你的子视图可能在这两个方法调用之中被移动了，明白了吗？

254
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:34,170
Any questions about that?
有什么问题吗？

255
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:39,008
So, yeah, these things might be called quite a lot and
好的，这些方法可能会经常被调用到

256
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,510
we'll see that in the demo that they might get called,
我们可以在 Demo 中看到，这些方法可能被调用

257
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:43,462
and called, and called.
调用、调用

258
00:11:43,463 --> 00:11:45,413
Autorotation, really you wanna think of
Autorotation，真正要考虑的是

259
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:49,718
autorotation primarily as just your bounds changed, so
你的边界的改变

260
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,720
autorotation is really a non-event.
所以 Autorotation 其实不是一个事件

261
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:55,856
As we have seen in all of our apps we have been writing so
目前为止，我们在我们的 App 中编写的代码

262
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:58,092
far, we don't even think about autorotation,
我们根本没有考虑过 Autorotation

263
00:11:58,094 --> 00:12:00,961
it just happens our bounds change, auto layout works and
它自动发生，我们的边界改变，Auto Layout 工作

264
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:03,380
the world is good.
一切都很正常

265
00:12:03,381 --> 00:12:05,798
And that's the way you should think of it 99% of the time,
那就是你99%的情况下会考虑的

266
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,833
but if for some reason,
但是在某些原因之下

267
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:11,203
you care about the actual case where rotation is happening,
你需要关心一下，怎么样的旋转正在发生？

268
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:13,905
in other words, your device got turned and
换言之，你的设备旋转了

269
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:16,775
so the bounds got to be wider than tall and when they used
边界是变宽了还是变窄了

270
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:20,345
to be taller than wide, then you can participate.
然后你可以参与这个过程，做一些事情

271
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:23,848
By the way, first line there says you can go to
顺便一提，这里的第一行说了，你可以

272
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,449
your project settings and
到你的项目设置（Project Settings）中

273
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:27,918
prevent certain autorotation from happening,
取消特定的 Autorotation

274
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,787
and the default by the way is that portrait upside down
默认取消的是，颠倒的竖屏模式

275
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:31,854
is prevented.

276
00:12:31,856 --> 00:12:33,856
That's why you noticed your app,
这就是你在我们的 App 中看到的

277
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:36,425
you go in the simulator and you rotate it to landscape and
当你在模拟器中，你旋转到了横屏模式

278
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:38,493
then you rotate it again to upside down and
然后你再进行一次旋转，到了颠倒的竖屏模式

279
00:12:38,495 --> 00:12:40,128
it doesn't autorotate,
我们的 App 并没有自动旋转

280
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,063
that's because in your private setting you said, oh,
这是因为在你的项目设置中，你说

281
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:45,199
portrait upside down is not a supported orientation.
“不支持颠倒的竖屏模式”

282
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:46,767
So when you go to portrait upside down,
所以，当你的 App 处于颠倒的竖屏模式中

283
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:49,603
it just does not autorotate, and you can flip those four
Autorotation 将不起作用，当然你可以

284
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:52,572
switches for the landscapes and portraits any way you
随意开关竖屏模式和横屏模式的四种模式

285
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:56,376
want, okay, it depends on your UI and what makes sense.
这一切都取决于你的用户界面

286
00:12:56,378 --> 00:12:59,145
Some UIs make no sense in landscape, some only make
一些用户界面不需要横屏模式

287
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:00,713
sense in landscape, there might be a game or
一些用户界面只需要横屏模式，比如说游戏

288
00:13:00,715 --> 00:13:04,449
something that just doesn't make sense in portrait, 'kay?
或者其他不适用于竖屏模式的应用，明白了吗？

289
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,384
So, but if you want to participate in the
所以，如果你想在 Autorotation 中插一手的话

290
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,821
autorotation, 'kay, like you want to do some animation of
比如你想要定制你自己的动画效果

291
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,656
your own, because you notice that the rotation is animated,
你注意到了旋转中的动画效果了吗？

292
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:16,026
right it goes from portrait to landscape, it kinda moves the
对，比如从竖屏模式切换到横屏模式

293
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,495
views around, it's hard to see cause it's happening so fast,
它移动了视图，但这个效果很难看清，因为速度实在是太快了

294
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:21,197
but it is animating it, and you can actually participate
但是，肯定是有动画的，你可以参与其中

295
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:24,934
that by this method viewWillTransitionToSize,
通过 viewWillTransitionToSize 这个方法

296
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:28,904
which is part of the life cycle.
同样也是 View Controller 生命周期的一部分

297
00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:30,772
And this transition coordinator you get,
而且你得到的变换坐标系

298
00:13:30,774 --> 00:13:32,340
now I'm not gonna talk about how to implement this,
现在我不打算说，如何去实现它

299
00:13:32,342 --> 00:13:33,708
I haven't even talked about animation,
因为我目前还没有谈到动画这部分

300
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,343
we're not gonna talk about that for a couple of weeks,
所以在最近的几周里，我们都不会讲到它

301
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:39,479
but there is a method in that coordinator, for example,
但是在那个 coordinator中有一个方法，比如说

302
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:43,649
called animate alongside, and you can specify what kinda
叫做 animate alongside，并且你可以指定什么样的

303
00:13:43,651 --> 00:13:46,452
animations you want to animate alongside the rotation.
动画你想要 animate alongside回转

304
00:13:46,454 --> 00:13:48,253
So I'm just telling you this now because it's part of

305
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:50,422
the view controller life cycle and

306
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:53,291
you should just know in your head that it exists.

307
00:13:53,293 --> 00:13:55,460
Okay, it's a little bit of a complicated thing to use,

308
00:13:55,462 --> 00:13:59,563
because when you rotate and you change bounds, really it's

309
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:02,433
container views that are most concerned with that, like

310
00:14:02,435 --> 00:14:05,502
a split view, it needs to now put both things on screen and

311
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:08,838
put a line and when you switch the other way.

312
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,175
It's really about container views, a little less than

313
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:15,277
about leaf view controllers, but leaf view controller might

314
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,180
wanna know what's going on, all right, and

315
00:14:18,182 --> 00:14:21,049
then low memory, you get this didReceiveMemoryWarning.

316
00:14:21,051 --> 00:14:22,684
Here you wanna throw away anything in

317
00:14:22,686 --> 00:14:25,186
the heap that's easy to reconstitute.

318
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:28,689
The way you throw things out of the heap, by the way,

319
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:34,094
is you just set all pointers that you have to them to nil,

320
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:36,329
okay, if you're not pointing to something,

321
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:38,664
then it won't stay in the heap, it gets thrown out.

322
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,299
That does not include weak pointers.

323
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:41,667
If you have a weak pointer to something,

324
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:43,435
it still gets thrown out, 'kay?

325
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:46,337
If the only pointer in the world to an image in the heap

326
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:48,205
is a weak pointer, it's gonna get pitched, and

327
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:50,040
that weak pointer's gonna get set to nil,

328
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:52,976
'kay, as we talked about when we talked about delegation,

329
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:57,580
'kay, that's the definition of a weak pointer, okay?

330
00:14:57,582 --> 00:15:00,449
So, in low memory situations, you know, try to clean up.

331
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:01,550
You'll all most never get this,

332
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:02,617
you may never, ever get this.

333
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:05,153
If your app is very highly image intensive,

334
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,621
maybe it's an image processing app and

335
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:09,757
you've got a lot of images in there, then it's possible,

336
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,192
I suppose, but it's extremely unlikely,

337
00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:14,361
'kay, there's a lot of memory in these devices.

338
00:15:15,964 --> 00:15:19,032
Okay, now I'm gonna go back to awakeFromNib, which is not

339
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:21,133
really part of the view controller life cycle,

340
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:23,018
but a view controller,

341
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:24,902
just like any other NS object subclass that comes out of

342
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:27,873
a storyboard, will get awakeFromNib.

343
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,775
And there are some students, as a class in the past,

344
00:15:30,777 --> 00:15:32,877
that have kind of abused awakeFromNib and they just

345
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,579
start trying to put everything in their initialization into

346
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:38,215
awakeFromNib instead of putting it into viewDidLoad or

347
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:41,585
viewWillAppear, or viewWillLayoutSubviews,

348
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:44,421
depending on what kind of thing it is.

349
00:15:44,423 --> 00:15:47,423
And I'm just warning you here, don't abuse awakeFromNib, but

350
00:15:47,425 --> 00:15:50,026
there are some cases where awakeFromNib is necessary.

351
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:52,561
For example, if you want to set yourself as the delegate

352
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:55,163
of the split view controller you're in, awayFromNib is

353
00:15:55,165 --> 00:15:57,632
a good place to do that, because then it happens really

354
00:15:57,634 --> 00:16:00,401
early and you'll start getting those delegate methods from

355
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:02,937
split view as you go through the rest of your life cycle.

356
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:05,139
Okay?

357
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,340
So there are some times when awakeFromNib is good.

358
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:10,010
All right, so here's the summary of the life cycle.

359
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,911
You get instantiated, usually from the storyboard.

360
00:16:11,913 --> 00:16:14,180
You're gonna get awakeFromNib.

361
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,015
Segue prep is gonna happen.

362
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,317
Your outlets are gonna get set by the system.

363
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:20,252
ViewDidLoad is gonna get called.

364
00:16:20,254 --> 00:16:21,720
View will appear and disappear.

365
00:16:21,722 --> 00:16:24,589
It's gonna happen as your controller goes on and

366
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:26,708
off screen.

367
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:28,826
And as your view controller's geometry changes or

368
00:16:28,828 --> 00:16:31,462
the subviews change in a way that needs to be re-laid out,

369
00:16:31,464 --> 00:16:33,063
you're gonna get WillLayoutSubviews,

370
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:34,931
then autolayout, then DidLayoutSubviews.

371
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:37,233
So that could happen many times.

372
00:16:37,235 --> 00:16:38,401
And if you get low on memory,

373
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:40,302
you could have this memory warning, okay?

374
00:16:40,304 --> 00:16:42,537
So that's the View Controller Lifecycle.

375
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:44,906
There is actually one other one in here.

376
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:48,810
It'll tell you when your size class changes.

377
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:50,845
But I haven't talked about size class yet, so

378
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:52,112
I didn't put that in this list.

379
00:16:52,114 --> 00:16:53,413
But there's one more, and

380
00:16:53,415 --> 00:16:57,017
there will transition to traits or something like that.

381
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:01,153
All right, so I'm gonna do a quick demo here, super fast.

382
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:06,991
Let me get something to drink here, okay?

383
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,826
So I'm gonna do a quick demo.

384
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:11,595
And all I did is I took Psychologist from last time,

385
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,497
and I just put a bunch of printlns in all

386
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,832
these View Controler Lifecycle methods, okay?

387
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:19,069
So that it would just print out where it is in

388
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,937
Lifecycle all the time.

389
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,204
So, let's go do that.

390
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:22,971
Let's go run that.

391
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:28,976
It is here in Developer, Psychologist Lecture 8.

392
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:30,378
Here we go.

393
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,713
So you can see that in viewWillAppear() I

394
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:35,749
put a little log for that, disappear, all these.

395
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:38,185
So I'm just making it basically

396
00:17:38,186 --> 00:17:40,620
logging all the things that are happening, okay.

397
00:17:40,622 --> 00:17:42,689
So lets go, I'm gonna run this on iPad.

398
00:17:44,058 --> 00:17:46,158
It's a little easier to make things happen here.

399
00:17:48,695 --> 00:17:50,561
All right, so here's our Psychologist.

400
00:17:50,563 --> 00:17:52,096
I haven't changed anything about the app.

401
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:55,232
I'm gonna make the console really big so

402
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:58,135
that we can see what's going on here.

403
00:17:58,137 --> 00:17:59,969
All right, so notice we came up.

404
00:17:59,971 --> 00:18:01,337
The detail is the only thing,

405
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:03,105
the detail is Happiness View Controller.

406
00:18:03,107 --> 00:18:04,606
It's the only thing visible.

407
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:06,341
So what happened here?

408
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:08,075
The Psychologist got pulled out of the storyboard.

409
00:18:08,078 --> 00:18:10,311
The Happiness got pulled out of the storyboard.

410
00:18:10,313 --> 00:18:12,380
This zero is which instance of it.

411
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,116
Cuz we're gonna have multiple instances, eventually.

412
00:18:15,118 --> 00:18:16,517
Then Happiness got awakeFromNib.

413
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:18,085
Then Psychologist got awakeFromNib.

414
00:18:18,087 --> 00:18:21,154
The order of awakeFromNib is completely not determinable,

415
00:18:21,156 --> 00:18:22,321
so you should not depend on it.

416
00:18:23,324 --> 00:18:25,524
Then the master got viewDidLoad.

417
00:18:25,526 --> 00:18:27,459
Even though the master never appears on screen,

418
00:18:27,461 --> 00:18:29,461
it still had its outlet set, and

419
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:31,362
got viewDidLoad sent to it.

420
00:18:31,364 --> 00:18:35,499
Then interestingly, the master was asked to lay itself out,

421
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:37,167
to lay its Subviews out.

422
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:38,601
Okay again, it hasn't appeared.

423
00:18:38,603 --> 00:18:40,203
It hasn't even gotten viewWillAppear,

424
00:18:40,205 --> 00:18:41,537
because it's not gonna appear.

425
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:46,942
But its Subviews wanna get laid out.

426
00:18:46,944 --> 00:18:47,942
And why is this happen?

427
00:18:47,944 --> 00:18:49,377
Well, you know, the system might be

428
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,513
preparing to animate it onscreen or something.

429
00:18:52,515 --> 00:18:53,313
You just want to make sure.

430
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:54,815
This is not doing any drawing.

431
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:56,400
This is just making sure

432
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,984
the Subviews are properly laid out.

433
00:18:57,986 --> 00:19:02,321
It happens twice here, maybe a before and after animation.

434
00:19:02,323 --> 00:19:03,489
Who knows what's going on here,

435
00:19:03,491 --> 00:19:05,023
it doesn't really matter.

436
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:07,859
The size didn't actually change.

437
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:09,260
Okay, the bound size didn't actually change, so

438
00:19:09,262 --> 00:19:11,595
this second one probably did almost nothing here.

439
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:15,832
Then the detail, Happiness, it gets a videwDidLoad and then

440
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:18,501
it gets a viewWillAppear, cuz it's gonna appear onscreen.

441
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:21,204
The animated is false because it doesn't animate on screen.

442
00:19:21,206 --> 00:19:23,172
It was the initial thing that shows up in screen, so

443
00:19:23,174 --> 00:19:24,473
boom, it just pops up there.

444
00:19:25,442 --> 00:19:28,343
It gets laid out and then it gets viewDidAppear.

445
00:19:28,345 --> 00:19:30,445
And here it is, okay?

446
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:31,779
Everyone understand that?

447
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:34,381
Now I'm going to rotate to landscape, and

448
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:36,049
that's gonna cause the master to appear.

449
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,450
So watch this.

450
00:19:37,452 --> 00:19:39,803
So we do rotate,

451
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,155
all these dash, that's what happened since I rotated here.

452
00:19:42,157 --> 00:19:45,224
And you can see Psychologist and Happiness both got

453
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,460
informed that this transition to size is going to happen.

454
00:19:48,462 --> 00:19:50,045
So they could have

455
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:51,629
participated in the animation if they want, and you're gonna

456
00:19:51,632 --> 00:19:54,199
see the animation happen in a little bit down the road here.

457
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:58,069
The master got another chance to lay its Subviews out in

458
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,269
a little different size.

459
00:19:59,271 --> 00:20:02,706
Because this size, it's only 768 high instead of

460
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:06,242
the full 1024, and it's a little wider too.

461
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:09,078
So it got laid out, then it got viewWillAppear.

462
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,715
So this guy was told it would appear, okay?

463
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:15,517
And this guy didn't get any viewWillAppear because it's

464
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:17,369
already there.

465
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,220
So it's not appearing, it was already there before.

466
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:22,291
So it gets viewWillAppear.

467
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:25,360
Now the detail gets chance to lay its Subviews out here at

468
00:20:25,362 --> 00:20:27,262
a new size.

469
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,163
Because it used to be the whole screen,

470
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:31,064
now it's just this part right here, so it got a new layout.

471
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:33,567
And then the master was asked to layout its Subviews again.

472
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:35,635
So you see how I'm saying this gets called a lot.

473
00:20:35,637 --> 00:20:37,504
So you just need to

474
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:39,372
make sure that if you're doing anything in these two methods,

475
00:20:39,374 --> 00:20:41,674
that it's okay to be doing it over and over.

476
00:20:41,676 --> 00:20:44,343
Here's where the actually animation happens.

477
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:46,945
And you can see that both the Psychologist and the Happiness

478
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:49,548
have been invited to animate alongside if they wanted to.

479
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:53,718
Then the master is asked to layout one more time,

480
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,653
same size.

481
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,587
That's the third time its been asked to do that.

482
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:02,092
And then the master gets viewDataAppear, okay?

483
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,728
Now the last thing I'm gonna do is click one of these,

484
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,330
which is gonna cause a segue which is gonna cause this to

485
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,564
be replaced.

486
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:10,232
So let's do that.

487
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:11,899
So we'll try the dancing tree here.

488
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:12,601
Okay?

489
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:13,802
So what happened here?

490
00:21:13,804 --> 00:21:14,802
A new Happiness.

491
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:18,839
Happiness 1 got instantiated here, okay?

492
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:21,508
We have Happiness 0 up here and Happiness 1.

493
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,645
It got prepared with Happiness of a hundred.

494
00:21:25,647 --> 00:21:27,180
Okay?

495
00:21:27,181 --> 00:21:28,714
Then layout Subviews of the master again.

496
00:21:28,716 --> 00:21:33,952
Then the Happiness 0 got viewWillDisappear.

497
00:21:33,954 --> 00:21:35,387
Happiness 0, that old Happiness of

498
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:37,105
course getting pulled out and

499
00:21:37,106 --> 00:21:38,822
replaced by the new one, so it got viewWillDisappear.

500
00:21:38,825 --> 00:21:41,525
Then the master got laid out again, and

501
00:21:41,527 --> 00:21:44,395
then viewDidLoad happened on Happiness 1,

502
00:21:44,397 --> 00:21:46,596
the new happiness that's appearing.

503
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:49,799
Then it got viewWillAppear cuz it's going to appear.

504
00:21:49,801 --> 00:21:51,768
Then it got a chance to be laid out.

505
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,236
The old Happiness disappeared.

506
00:21:54,238 --> 00:21:56,972
The new Happiness appeared and then the old

507
00:21:56,974 --> 00:21:59,274
Happiness got deinitialized, thrown out of the heap.

508
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,476
Because like I said, once you segue away from it,

509
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,312
boom, it's gone.

510
00:22:04,313 --> 00:22:05,045
Okay? So that's all I

511
00:22:05,048 --> 00:22:06,413
wanted to cover there.

512
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:08,348
Everybody cool with that?

513
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:10,282
Any questions about that View Controller Lifecycle?

514
00:22:12,387 --> 00:22:14,086
It's pretty straightforward, but you can already probably

515
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:15,821
imagine in your head some things that you were

516
00:22:15,823 --> 00:22:18,790
doing in your code that's like oh, I wish I had viewDidLoad.

517
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:20,158
That really could have

518
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,893
initialized some stuff there a little simpler.

519
00:22:21,895 --> 00:22:24,562
All right, so let's go back to our slides.

520
00:22:25,865 --> 00:22:29,232
All right, so you've seen a lot of Autolayout already in

521
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:31,017
this class, so

522
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,801
I'm gonna review briefly the things you should know.

523
00:22:32,804 --> 00:22:35,204
One is you know about using the dashed lines.

524
00:22:36,374 --> 00:22:40,175
Using the blue dashed lines is helping the interface builder.

525
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:41,810
By the way, when I refer to interface builder,

526
00:22:41,812 --> 00:22:44,579
that means Xcode, the storyboard part of Xcode.

527
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:46,781
We call that interface builder for historical reasons.

528
00:22:48,184 --> 00:22:50,984
So, when you're in the storyboard of Xcode,

529
00:22:50,986 --> 00:22:54,388
the dashed lines are kind of telling Xcode what you want,

530
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,889
what you intend.

531
00:22:55,891 --> 00:22:57,824
As best that you can, okay?

532
00:22:57,826 --> 00:23:01,227
Then you know about Ctrl-dragging between views to

533
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:03,095
create relationships, right?

534
00:23:03,097 --> 00:23:05,864
Like spacing, and hook this to the left edge, and

535
00:23:05,866 --> 00:23:06,898
stuff like that.

536
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,467
You know about those in the lower right corner,

537
00:23:09,469 --> 00:23:12,603
the "Pin" and "Arranged" popovers down there that let

538
00:23:12,605 --> 00:23:15,839
you do things like set all the things to equal widths, or

539
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:17,507
create spacing between all of them, or

540
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:19,776
line up their left edges, okay?

541
00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:23,346
You know about using Reset to Suggested Constraints.

542
00:23:23,348 --> 00:23:24,747
If you use the blue lines,

543
00:23:24,749 --> 00:23:27,583
sometimes you'll do Reset to Suggested Constraints, and

544
00:23:27,585 --> 00:23:29,584
it will actually figure out what you want.

545
00:23:29,586 --> 00:23:30,819
I'd say only 50 percent of the time,

546
00:23:30,821 --> 00:23:32,420
but it's worth a try sometimes.

547
00:23:34,557 --> 00:23:35,722
The Document Outline,

548
00:23:35,724 --> 00:23:37,724
you know that on the left in the document outline,

549
00:23:37,726 --> 00:23:39,726
all your constraints are listed there.

550
00:23:39,728 --> 00:23:41,093
Okay. And also that's where,

551
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:44,029
if you've got problems, you can click on the little red or

552
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:45,797
yellow button in the upper right-hand corner of

553
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,499
the Document Outline and it'll tell you.

554
00:23:47,501 --> 00:23:51,836
It might even suggest some ways to fix things, possibly.

555
00:23:51,838 --> 00:23:53,704
And certainly will tell you if anything's misplaced.

556
00:23:53,706 --> 00:23:56,807
And you know from there, you can also fix your misplaced

557
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:59,743
views by clicking on the little triangles in there.

558
00:23:59,745 --> 00:24:01,577
You know about the size inspector.

559
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:03,579
If you inspect a view in your storyboard and

560
00:24:03,581 --> 00:24:05,080
you look at the size inspector,

561
00:24:05,082 --> 00:24:07,282
you'll see all the constraints listed there.

562
00:24:07,284 --> 00:24:10,818
In there, all the constraints are shown with their details.

563
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,104
Okay?

564
00:24:13,105 --> 00:24:15,389
What the constants are, all that stuff, is listed there.

565
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:19,859
And of course you can edit the constraints there.

566
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:22,929
You can also, you know that you can click on a constraint.

567
00:24:22,931 --> 00:24:24,363
And bring up the attributes inspector.

568
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:27,232
And now you can inspect the constraint directly, okay?

569
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:29,234
It will be the thing that's selected so the attributes

570
00:24:29,236 --> 00:24:31,936
inspector will let you set its attributes, okay?

571
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:34,906
So you know a lot here about autolayout.

572
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:37,041
And that is basically what autolayout is.

573
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:38,409
It's those things.

574
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:40,877
Okay, now again, as I've said many times,

575
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,079
mastering autolayout requires experience.

576
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,715
You gotta know how to use all these tools,

577
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,450
to greatest effect, okay.

578
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,818
You gotta familiarize yourself with what things can I

579
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,355
align to things, what things can I pin to here and there,

580
00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:56,391
what things can I set as my constants that make sense.

581
00:24:56,393 --> 00:24:58,192
You gotta learn all that by doing, okay.

582
00:24:58,194 --> 00:25:00,994
I could spend many days going through every possible one.

583
00:25:03,532 --> 00:25:05,932
Autolayout can be done in code.

584
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:08,568
There are objects, classes,

585
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,737
in iOS that represent what's going on in autolayout.

586
00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:14,273
And in the demo I'm gonna actually show you an example

587
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:16,475
of doing that so you can get an idea of what it looks like.

588
00:25:16,477 --> 00:25:17,909
But we rarely do that.

589
00:25:17,911 --> 00:25:20,611
If we can do it in the storyboard, we do it there.

590
00:25:20,613 --> 00:25:23,114
We only revert to doing it in code when it's like,

591
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:26,817
we just can't express that somehow in the storyboard,

592
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:28,418
which is extremely rare.

593
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,822
But I'll show you a case where that's true, but all right.

594
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:37,159
So what about rotation?

595
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,361
As I said, when you have rotation,

596
00:25:39,363 --> 00:25:44,065
you're just going to rely on your autolayout to do that.

597
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:48,935
But occasionally when you rotate, things have changed so

598
00:25:48,937 --> 00:25:52,339
drastically in terms of the shape that autolayout just

599
00:25:52,341 --> 00:25:53,206
can't do it.

600
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:55,408
It can't move a view where you want.

601
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,343
So what's an example of that?
所以有什么这方面的例子呢？

602
00:25:57,345 --> 00:25:59,077
Lets consider our calculator.
让我回忆一下我们的计算器

603
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:01,813
Okay lets say we had 20 buttons in our calculator.
好的，我们的计算器有20个按键

604
00:26:01,815 --> 00:26:02,447
Okay.
好的

605
00:26:02,449 --> 00:26:04,816
Now in landscape,
现在横屏

606
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:07,184
I might want them to be five buttons across and four down.
那么我希望它应该有五列四行

607
00:26:07,186 --> 00:26:08,585
But when I switch to portrait,
但是当我想转换成竖屏

608
00:26:08,587 --> 00:26:10,454
now I might want four across and five down.
现在我希望它是四列五行

609
00:26:11,823 --> 00:26:13,373
Okay, there's no
没有办法

610
00:26:13,374 --> 00:26:14,924
way you're gonna write autolayout to do that.
使用自动布局去实现这个效果

611
00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:19,128
Autolayout cannot make such a huge change like doing that.
自动布局不能做如此巨大的变动

612
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,296
Okay, so how do we deal with that?
所以我们该怎么解决呢？

613
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:23,031
We still wanna do that, so how do we do it?
我们仍然想要做到这个效果，那我们要怎么做呢?

614
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:28,802
It's not just in the case of rotation where this is
这也并不是只在旋转情况下

615
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:30,003
happening to.
发生

616
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,639
It also happens, for example, in a split view.
它也同样发生在, 比如说分屏的时候

617
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:36,576
When you have the master in the spilt view on the left,
当你左侧屏幕的主干

618
00:26:36,578 --> 00:26:39,612
it kind of is tall and thin, just like it was on an iPhone.
它高高瘦瘦的, 就像它在 iPhone 一样

619
00:26:39,614 --> 00:26:42,047
Even though it was on an iPad, it's kind of in a shape,
但是它其实是在 iPad 上，就像在一块形状里面

620
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:44,850
a space that's shaped more like an iPhone, right?
一个就像 iPhone 的形状，懂吗？

621
00:26:44,852 --> 00:26:47,652
Lots of vertical space, but not much horizontal space.
有很多垂直空间，但是只有很少的水平空间

622
00:26:47,654 --> 00:26:50,104
So it's not just rotation where we
也并不是只有在旋转

623
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:52,555
care about this size business, the relative size of things.
我们所在意的尺寸，相对大小事物

624
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:57,694
So the solution to this is called size classes, and so
因此这解决方式叫作尺寸等级，并且

625
00:26:57,696 --> 00:27:00,697
your view controller always exists in
的视图控制器一直存在

626
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:03,399
a size class environment.
这个尺寸等级的环境里

627
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:05,100
For width and height.
对于所有的宽度高度来说

628
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:08,703
And currently the size class can either be compact
并且当前的尺寸等级可以是紧凑的

629
00:27:08,705 --> 00:27:09,804
or regular.
或者是普通的

630
00:27:09,806 --> 00:27:11,839
Regular just means it's not compact.
普通意味着就不紧凑

631
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:15,743
Okay, and so lets try and
好的, 让我们试一下

632
00:27:15,745 --> 00:27:19,613
understand what when you're in these different situations.
理解当你在这些不同的情景之下的反应

633
00:27:19,615 --> 00:27:24,217
So for example the iPhone 6+ is an interesting device.
比如 iPhone6+是一个有意思的设备

634
00:27:24,219 --> 00:27:27,920
In portrait it's width is compact.
在竖屏下它的宽是紧凑的

635
00:27:27,922 --> 00:27:29,321
It's height is regular.
它的高是普通的

636
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,407
Okay so that's if you
因此如果你

637
00:27:32,408 --> 00:27:34,425
had like a full screen view controller on an iPhone 6+.
在 iPhone 6+ 上满屏操作

638
00:27:34,427 --> 00:27:37,795
When you go to landscape on the 6+ now it's compact in
当你6+横屏时现在高

639
00:27:37,797 --> 00:27:39,530
height and regular in width.
紧凑, 宽普通

640
00:27:40,966 --> 00:27:42,399
That make sense?
要怎么做呢？

641
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:44,901
All right, it makes perfect sense in that one.
当然, 要做一个完美的感受

642
00:27:44,903 --> 00:27:46,669
But the iPhone is kind of an interesting one,
但是 iPhone 是一个有意思的设备

643
00:27:46,671 --> 00:27:49,171
other iPhones besides the iPhone 6+,
其他 iPhone 除 iPhone 6+ 之外的

644
00:27:49,173 --> 00:27:53,041
in portrait it is compact in width and regular in height,
竖屏时宽紧凑高普通

645
00:27:53,043 --> 00:27:55,677
just like an iPhone 6+, but in landscaped,
就像是 iPhone 6+, 但是在横屏的时候

646
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,147
it is considered compact in width and compact in height.
它应该被考虑成宽紧凑高也是紧凑

647
00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:02,383
And that might seem non-intuitive,.
它不是凭直觉的

648
00:28:02,385 --> 00:28:06,653
But it just turns out that a non iPhone 6+, the width of
但是事实证明非 iPhone 6+，这个宽

649
00:28:06,655 --> 00:28:09,823
it is just not quite enough to say this is a regular width.
它不充分作为普通宽

650
00:28:09,825 --> 00:28:12,492
Most UIs just will look better if you
大部分 UI 只是看起来友好如果你

651
00:28:12,494 --> 00:28:14,994
consider it compact, okay?
只是考虑它的紧凑性，了解吗？

652
00:28:14,996 --> 00:28:18,964
Now the iPad is always regular in both directions.
现在 iPad 一直作为全方向上的普通处理

653
00:28:18,966 --> 00:28:20,632
Portrait or landscape, it's always so
竖屏或者横屏，它一直都是

654
00:28:20,634 --> 00:28:22,734
big that it's just regular in both directions.
大并且全方向普通

655
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:24,635
There's no compact on the iPad.
iPad 上面没有紧凑

656
00:28:24,637 --> 00:28:26,370
But again a particular view controller on
但是再次声明一个特别的视图控制器

657
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:27,904
an iPad like the master of
在 iPad 上面主要

658
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:31,074
a split view side by side that's going to be compact.
分屏并列紧凑的

659
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:34,844
Regular height, compact width.
普通的高, 紧凑的宽

660
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,947
All right, this whole thing is extensible it's not kinda all
当然, 整个事物都是可扩展的, 它没有

661
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,715
frozen in stone.
固定住

662
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,983
You if you have a view controller you can find out
你如果你有一个视图控制器你可以发现

663
00:28:41,985 --> 00:28:45,987
your size class by using this property called trait
你尺寸等级，它是通过使用的属性即特征

664
00:28:45,989 --> 00:28:47,121
collection.
集合

665
00:28:47,123 --> 00:28:48,489
And inside traitCollection,
并且在特征集合里

666
00:28:48,491 --> 00:28:50,957
it's gonna return the horizontal size class and
它将返回水平尺寸等级和

667
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:52,976
the vertical size class,
竖直尺寸等级

668
00:28:52,977 --> 00:28:54,994
and that's just an enum that's either .Compact or
并且这只是枚举的两种。紧凑

669
00:28:54,996 --> 00:28:56,429
.Regular, okay?
或者普通，了解？

670
00:28:56,431 --> 00:29:00,232
Now, you probably almost never need to do this because you're
现在你很可能几乎从不需要这些因为你将

671
00:29:00,234 --> 00:29:03,669
gonna edit this in your storyboard, 'kay?

674
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:10,942
And then your code, it's just all gonna work.
然后你的代码，它将正常工作

675
00:29:10,944 --> 00:29:12,176
Okay as long as you got your
直到你的自动布局

676
00:29:12,178 --> 00:29:14,111
rest of your auto layout going.
不起作用的时候

677
00:29:14,113 --> 00:29:16,130
So how does that work?
要怎么让它工作？

678
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:18,148
All right so here's the size classes right horizontal and
当然这里有尺寸等级正确的水平和

679
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,383
vertical, compact and regular.
垂直，紧凑和普通

680
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:21,918

that's every possible combination.
这每一个都可能是混合的

682
00:29:24,088 --> 00:29:27,956
Okay and so for my calculator for example here's what
对于我们的计算器比如这里

683
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:30,992
my UI might look like in those situations.
我们的 UI 可能看起来在这些情况下

684
00:29:30,994 --> 00:29:33,995
Okay you see here that I've gone five across and four

685
00:29:33,997 --> 00:29:39,467
down when I have a compact height and regular width.
当它高紧凑宽普通

686
00:29:39,469 --> 00:29:47,507
But I basically anytime I have a regular width I'm gonna
但是我基本定期有一个普通的宽我将

687
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:51,711
go what did I do, every time I actually every time I have.

689
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:01,953
Okay so lower right is regular height, it's five high.

690
00:30:01,955 --> 00:30:04,422
Lower left is regular height is five high.

00:30:06,492 --> 00:30:10,093
I've gone to four high five wide.
我将设置四列五行

693
00:30:10,095 --> 00:30:12,028

So it'd be kinda a pain though if I had to do all four of
它有些问题以至于我只能设置四个

695
00:30:13,965 --> 00:30:16,866
these for every user interface I built.
这些每一个我建立的用户界面

696
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:20,703
So we actually have another size class called any.
因此我们的确有其他的尺寸等级

697
00:30:20,705 --> 00:30:23,872
And if you throw any into the mix,
并且如果你抛弃这些混乱的

698
00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:27,642
now I can do this exactly the way I just said which is.
现在我可以确定这个我所说的这个方式

699
00:30:27,644 --> 00:30:31,245
Any, first of all I'm gonna have an any any,
当然，起先我需要这个 any any 

700
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,347
which is the middle, and that's gonna be my base UI.
这个在中间，这些作为我的基本用户界面

701
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:38,018
So, if I don't specify any particular size class, it's
因此，如果我指定一些特殊的尺寸等级

702
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,453
gonna look like that, which is four across and five down.
它就像是这个四列五行

703
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:44,289
But in the case where it's vertically compact.
但是在这个垂直紧凑的条件下

704
00:30:45,793 --> 00:30:48,727
I'm going to go to five across and only four high.
我将它设置为五列可是只有四列

705
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:50,361
And I don't care what the width is so

706
00:30:50,363 --> 00:30:51,629
that's why it's any.
为什么它是 any

707
00:30:51,631 --> 00:30:53,664
So now I only have to do two user interfaces.
现在我只想做好这两个用户界面

712
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:06,208
things and
这个和

still covers all the same bases as the previous slide.
仍然覆盖的所有的正如之前幻灯片相同的基本框架

714
00:31:08,145 --> 00:31:12,480
And incredibly, Interface Builder will have a graph that

715
00:31:12,482 --> 00:31:15,750
looks almost exactly like this slide that lets you pick
看起来就像幻灯片所说的你所选的

716
00:31:15,752 --> 00:31:18,752
between these various boxes, and you can design your
这些不同盒子之间的，你可以设计你

717
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:20,854
user interface in any of these boxes.
用户界面

718
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,222
Okay? And it will

719
00:31:23,224 --> 00:31:24,457
just magically work.

it's just an app that I wrote that shows the size
这个应用，我是为了展示尺寸

724
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,369
class of whatever device you're on at the time.
等级不管你现在处于何种设备之下

725
00:31:38,371 --> 00:31:39,553
Okay?
可否？

726
00:31:39,554 --> 00:31:40,736
And we're gonna take a look at the code for that.
我们将看一下这个代码

727
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:43,173
And then I'm gonna do an app from scratch.
然后我先用 scratch 做这个应用

728
00:31:43,175 --> 00:31:45,208
Which is called Autolayout.
这个被称为自动布局

the size class problem that we're gonna have to solve.
尺寸等级等这些我们会解决的问题

733
00:31:52,082 --> 00:31:53,615
Okay so it's kind of kitchen sink of that.
这就像是厨房的污水槽

734
00:31:53,617 --> 00:31:55,516
All right let's go and

Grab another one, put this here.

912
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,581
Okay, now, I'm gonna use some model layout stuff you

913
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:46,248
already know about.

914
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,582
I'm gonna use Ctrll drag.

915
00:39:47,584 --> 00:39:50,919
Let's stick this one trailing space to that edge.

916
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,854
Let's stick this one with this trailing space to that end.

917
00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:55,256
Let's get this one to the top.

918
00:39:55,258 --> 00:39:56,423
Let's put a space in

919
00:39:56,425 --> 00:39:58,892
between the vertical space between them.

920
00:39:58,894 --> 00:39:59,793
You know about.

921
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:01,394
Doing all those kind of things.

922
00:40:01,396 --> 00:40:04,397
Now one thing as I'm working with auto layout I

923
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:07,799
often like to click this little button right here.

924
00:40:08,735 --> 00:40:10,535
Because this will

925
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:12,336
give you a little summary of what's going on.

926
00:40:13,473 --> 00:40:16,373
And when all it's complaining about is that frames are gonna

927
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,810
be moved, a cool thing you can do is go down here

928
00:40:19,812 --> 00:40:21,411
to this button.

929
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:24,881
The same one where we do Reset to Suggested Constraints and

930
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:27,717
Clear Constraints, there's this Update Frame.

931
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:33,789
And it will update all frames in your storyboard.

932
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:35,990
Now, it made those smaller because the text in

933
00:40:35,992 --> 00:40:38,059
them is small, but don't worry about that.

934
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,326
We're gonna fix that later.

935
00:40:39,328 --> 00:40:41,829
So I did Undo right there because I wanted them to be

936
00:40:41,831 --> 00:40:44,698
a little bigger just as I work.

937
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,832
Okay? But I'll be going back to

938
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:47,400
look at this often.

939
00:40:47,402 --> 00:40:48,734
And if I see it's just frames,

940
00:40:48,736 --> 00:40:50,202
then I'll be doing Update Frames.

941
00:40:50,204 --> 00:40:51,636
And if I don't like what it did I

942
00:40:51,638 --> 00:40:52,804
can always undo, keep going.

943
00:40:52,806 --> 00:40:54,405
All right?

944
00:40:54,407 --> 00:40:58,175
So let's go and do our things here for

945
00:40:58,177 --> 00:41:02,846
the user name and password fields.

946
00:41:02,848 --> 00:41:04,914
So I'm just going to put some text in these.

947
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:05,915
Password.

948
00:41:07,185 --> 00:41:09,351
User name, so

949
00:41:09,353 --> 00:41:12,421
these ones I kind of want to be on the left.

950
00:41:12,423 --> 00:41:13,588
Okay, if you remember.

951
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,590
So I'm gonna do the same thing here with control drag.

952
00:41:15,592 --> 00:41:18,125
Let's set that leaning space.

953
00:41:18,127 --> 00:41:19,993
Let's set that leaning space.

954
00:41:19,995 --> 00:41:21,294
Let's set this thing to the,

955
00:41:21,296 --> 00:41:22,929
actually I'm not even gonna set this to the top.

956
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:24,464
Now this is an interesting one.

957
00:41:24,466 --> 00:41:26,766
So I have these two guys right here.

958
00:41:26,768 --> 00:41:30,069
Really what I want them to do is be lined up with whatever

959
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,136
the text is in here.

960
00:41:31,138 --> 00:41:33,938
I wanna line them up by their baselines.

961
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,842
So I'm gonna control drag between the two of them and

962
00:41:37,844 --> 00:41:40,310
go down here and pick Baseline.

963
00:41:40,312 --> 00:41:43,313
So this is going to line up their baselines.

964
00:41:43,315 --> 00:41:44,314
Okay?

965
00:41:44,316 --> 00:41:47,016
Same thing here, drag this one.

966
00:41:47,018 --> 00:41:48,918
And line up their baselines there.

967
00:41:50,087 --> 00:41:53,155
Now, another thing I want is that I want them to be kind

968
00:41:53,157 --> 00:41:54,989
of, well, I want these two guys, username and

969
00:41:54,991 --> 00:41:57,458
password, to be the same width.

970
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,260
So, I'm control dragging between them and

971
00:41:59,262 --> 00:42:01,095
saying Equal Widths.

972
00:42:01,097 --> 00:42:03,364
You remember in the calculator we

973
00:42:03,365 --> 00:42:05,632
did the equal widths down here with this thing, okay?

974
00:42:05,634 --> 00:42:07,300
But, you can do it with control drag as well.

975
00:42:08,436 --> 00:42:10,469
And then also I want these things attached.

976
00:42:10,471 --> 00:42:13,539
So I want that thing attached to each other so

977
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:15,674
that its horizontal spacing is set.

978
00:42:15,676 --> 00:42:17,509
And I want this thing attached to this,

979
00:42:17,511 --> 00:42:18,476
its horizontal spacing.

980
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:22,179
Now I've done all this stuff even though

981
00:42:22,181 --> 00:42:24,648
they're really not where I want them right now.

982
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:27,650
So usually you can kinda set things up and

983
00:42:27,652 --> 00:42:30,620
then just go into the size inspector.

984
00:42:30,622 --> 00:42:32,722
And inspect all of them and

985
00:42:32,724 --> 00:42:35,057
get rid of every magic number you see.

986
00:42:36,493 --> 00:42:38,760
If you get rid of every magic number you see usually it's

987
00:42:38,762 --> 00:42:40,294
gonna do exactly what you want.

988
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:41,996
So lets go here, lets start with this one.

989
00:42:41,998 --> 00:42:43,030
Lets find some magic numbers.

990
00:42:43,032 --> 00:42:44,731
Look at this Leading Space Username.

991
00:42:44,733 --> 00:42:46,366
[SOUND] Magic number.

992
00:42:46,368 --> 00:42:48,735
Okay magic number means number in here,

993
00:42:48,737 --> 00:42:51,103
anything that's a number get rid of it.

994
00:42:51,105 --> 00:42:52,137
So 392 I'm gonna get rid of that,

995
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:54,473
I'm gonna do it by going up here.

996
00:42:54,475 --> 00:42:57,075
Instead of having 392,

997
00:42:57,076 --> 00:42:59,676
I'm going to pick Standard Value, okay?

998
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:00,878
So now it's gone.

999
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,212
So you can click on these things and

1000
00:43:02,214 --> 00:43:04,481
click Edit to get rid of these.
点击编辑来去掉他们

1001
00:43:04,483 --> 00:43:08,084
Even 8, which had got by the blue lines, okay?
即使是8，是通过蓝色的线条来得到的，明白？

1002
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,452
I don't like that either.
我同样也不喜欢那个

1003
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:10,819
I'm just going to go here and say zero, because
我将要到这里并说0，因为

1004
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:13,956
I want that to be right up against the edge, okay?
我想要挨着那个边界，明白？

1005
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,458
Oops. Sorry.
哦，对不起

1006
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,294
Same thing, oh, did I do the right thing there?
同样的，我在这里做的对么？

1007
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:22,364
Leading space, username, yeah, trailing spaces, you're right.
距离顶部的空间，用户名，好的，距离底部的空间，你是对的

1008
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:23,949
How about this one?
这个怎么样？

1009
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,533
Top Space to Top Layout right here,
这里就是顶部布局的顶部空间

1010
00:43:25,535 --> 00:43:26,867
I'll use the Standard Value for that.
我将对它们使用默认的值

1011
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:28,135
Okay?
明白？

1012
00:43:28,137 --> 00:43:30,270
Oops, sorry, keep clicking there.
哦，对不起，继续点击那里

1013
00:43:30,272 --> 00:43:33,340
And then here, Align Baseline equals three.
然后在这里，距离基线的距离等于3

1014
00:43:33,342 --> 00:43:36,609
Okay I want these baselines exactly aligned not three off
好的我想要这些基线的实际距离不为3

1015
00:43:36,611 --> 00:43:39,912
of each other so I'm gonna say zero right here.
所以我准备在这里设置为0

1016
00:43:39,914 --> 00:43:44,249
So I've gotten rid of all the magic numbers in here.

1017
00:43:44,251 --> 00:43:46,351
Okay now lets do it for

1018
00:43:46,352 --> 00:43:48,452
this one, okay this one also has a magic number here,

1019
00:43:48,455 --> 00:43:51,622
lets change that to be Standard Value.

1020
00:43:51,624 --> 00:43:53,391
We got this one, Align Baseline.

1021
00:43:53,393 --> 00:43:54,658
We want that to be zero.

1022
00:43:55,928 --> 00:43:57,060
Okay? So we got rid of that.

1023
00:43:57,062 --> 00:43:57,827
How about this one?

1024
00:43:57,829 --> 00:44:00,396
Oh, this one's good.

1025
00:44:00,398 --> 00:44:01,497
No magic value.

1026
00:44:01,499 --> 00:44:03,165
And this one, also good.

1027
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:04,165
Okay? All is good.

1028
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:05,833
All is well with the world.

1029
00:44:05,835 --> 00:44:07,118
Okay?

1030
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,402
But we still have this up here.

1031
00:44:08,404 --> 00:44:10,237
Frame will be different at run time, so

1032
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:12,005
I'm going to go down here.

1033
00:44:12,007 --> 00:44:14,874
And update our frames and this looks good.

1034
00:44:14,876 --> 00:44:17,910
Now, when I look at this I'm like that's really not what I

1035
00:44:17,912 --> 00:44:20,946
want, so I must have made a mistake.

1036
00:44:20,948 --> 00:44:23,082
For example, I want this spacing in-between not to

1037
00:44:23,084 --> 00:44:24,817
be zero, so

1038
00:44:24,818 --> 00:44:26,551
I typed zero somewhere where I wanted a standard value.

1039
00:44:26,553 --> 00:44:29,220
So, let's go back here and see where that is.

1040
00:44:29,222 --> 00:44:30,588
Okay? It looks like it's this one

1041
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:33,157
you can tell when you mouse over these, it tells you.

1042
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:34,692
So here let's go back to here and

1043
00:44:34,694 --> 00:44:37,894
instead of zero, let's say Standard Value, okay?

1044
00:44:37,896 --> 00:44:39,829
And it moved it there for us.

1045
00:44:40,999 --> 00:44:42,065
Sometimes it moves it,

1046
00:44:42,066 --> 00:44:43,132
sometimes you need to do update frames.

1047
00:44:43,134 --> 00:44:44,300
It just kind of depends on

1048
00:44:44,301 --> 00:44:45,467
the character of the change you're making.

1049
00:44:47,804 --> 00:44:49,103
Okay?

1050
00:44:49,105 --> 00:44:51,238
Now, here's a really cool thing.

1051
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,124
I want to see what

1052
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:55,009
this looks like in portrait and landscape.

1053
00:44:55,011 --> 00:44:57,144
So yeah, I could go up here and hit Run,

1054
00:44:57,146 --> 00:45:00,380
but there is a lot faster way, which is to open up

1055
00:45:01,883 --> 00:45:05,384
the assistant editor here and instead of showing your view

1056
00:45:05,386 --> 00:45:08,253
controller, go up here and go down to Preview.

1057
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:11,522
This will preview your UI.

1058
00:45:13,259 --> 00:45:15,726
Okay? And you can preview it in

1059
00:45:16,795 --> 00:45:18,795
either landscape or portrait.

1060
00:45:18,797 --> 00:45:21,564
You can also preview it on other devices like

1061
00:45:21,566 --> 00:45:25,000
maybe an iPhone 6 Plus, okay, which is kind of so

1062
00:45:25,002 --> 00:45:28,303
big that we can't barely even see it here.

1063
00:45:28,305 --> 00:45:30,238
Barely flip it around, okay?

1064
00:45:31,174 --> 00:45:33,341
Or you can even look at it on an iPad if you wanted.

1065
00:45:34,276 --> 00:45:38,111
Okay I think four inches works best for

1066
00:45:38,113 --> 00:45:39,846
this small resolution I have.

1067
00:45:39,848 --> 00:45:43,549
But this is really cool, now this can only preview your UI

1068
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,651
for things that aren't running your code.

1069
00:45:45,653 --> 00:45:47,419
Okay so if you're gonna do something that you need to

1070
00:45:47,421 --> 00:45:49,587
run your code then you need to go run it in the app.

1071
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:51,256
But if you just want to

1072
00:45:51,257 --> 00:45:52,924
see how is the auto layout gonna work.

1073
00:45:52,926 --> 00:45:54,876
You can do this.

1074
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,827
Now another thing that's cool here is what's this gonna look

1075
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:59,596
like when you give it off to your localization guys and

1076
00:45:59,598 --> 00:46:03,500
if this gets translated to German or something like that.

1077
00:46:03,502 --> 00:46:05,602
You can do that, you can kinda make sure that you

1078
00:46:05,604 --> 00:46:07,837
don't have any big problems by going down here,

1079
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,772
see where it says English.

1080
00:46:09,774 --> 00:46:10,739
Sort of click on that.

1081
00:46:11,942 --> 00:46:14,476
And we can go to this double length pseudo language.

1082
00:46:14,478 --> 00:46:17,611
And all that does is doubles every text.

1083
00:46:19,081 --> 00:46:22,416
Okay? So even a long translation of

1084
00:46:22,418 --> 00:46:25,118
the word Username would fit there.

1085
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,420
And my auto layout is working properly.

1086
00:46:27,422 --> 00:46:29,689
And so my translation is just going to work.

1087
00:46:29,691 --> 00:46:31,824
So Auto Layout is not just used for

1088
00:46:31,826 --> 00:46:33,325
landscape versus portrait or whatever.

1089
00:46:33,327 --> 00:46:35,226
It can be used for translation as well.

1090
00:46:35,228 --> 00:46:36,694
When you're localizing things,

1091
00:46:36,696 --> 00:46:38,896
you want auto-layout to make things fit.

1092
00:46:38,898 --> 00:46:43,266
Okay? Everyone understand that?

1093
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:44,034
Okay.

1094
00:46:44,036 --> 00:46:44,934
All right, good.

1095
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:46,602
So we're making progress here.

1096
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:49,438
By the way, you probably don't wanna have preview open as

1097
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,605
you're doing a lot of changes here,

1098
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,008
cuz it's gonna be constantly previewing in real time.

1099
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,709
So if you've got a really powerful machine,

1100
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:56,060
it could keep up, but

1101
00:46:56,061 --> 00:46:57,410
you might be asking it to do a lot of calculations.

1102
00:46:57,413 --> 00:46:59,947
So I usually close that while I'm working, and

1103
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:01,548
then just bring it back whenever I wanna preview.

1104
00:47:02,718 --> 00:47:04,417
So let's do those two buttons.

1105
00:47:04,419 --> 00:47:06,452
Remember, I had the button change security,

1106
00:47:06,454 --> 00:47:08,020
which changed this to secure, and

1107
00:47:08,022 --> 00:47:10,255
then I had the button login, so let's go ahead and do that.

1108
00:47:11,258 --> 00:47:13,157
Another trick I'm going to show you is, and

1109
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:16,227
I'm always scrolling around in here trying to find things.

1110
00:47:16,229 --> 00:47:18,195
You can actually find things real quick by going down to

1111
00:47:18,197 --> 00:47:19,763
the bottom here and typing like button.

1112
00:47:19,765 --> 00:47:23,199
Now it's only going to show you the buttons.

1113
00:47:23,201 --> 00:47:25,001
Okay? We got Bar Button and

1114
00:47:25,003 --> 00:47:27,503
here's regular button, so I'm going to drag that out.

1115
00:47:27,505 --> 00:47:29,338
Let's get a couple of those buttons.

1116
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:33,408
We'll call this one Change security.

1117
00:47:34,444 --> 00:47:35,810
We'll call this one log in.

1118
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,612
Okay now where do these want to be?

1119
00:47:38,614 --> 00:47:40,347
They kind of

1120
00:47:40,348 --> 00:47:42,081
want to be underneath there something like that.

1121
00:47:42,084 --> 00:47:45,084
Definitely I like their baselines lined

1122
00:47:45,086 --> 00:47:46,619
up right there.

1123
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,153
So let's go ahead and kind of put those in position.

1124
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:51,490
I'm gonna set the vertical spacing between the login and

1125
00:47:51,492 --> 00:47:52,791
this guy right here and

1126
00:47:52,793 --> 00:47:56,461
then I'm control dragging here to set the baselines the same.

1127
00:47:56,463 --> 00:47:58,947
Okay?

1128
00:47:58,948 --> 00:48:01,432
Now, that has actually set the vertical position of both of

1129
00:48:01,434 --> 00:48:03,066
these things, okay.

1130
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:05,135
Because the vertical position of these are set and so

1131
00:48:05,137 --> 00:48:07,070
when I tie this vertical position here and

1132
00:48:07,072 --> 00:48:10,306
the baseline which is a vertical positioning here but

1133
00:48:10,308 --> 00:48:13,776
if I go up here it says that the horizontal position of

1134
00:48:13,778 --> 00:48:16,445
Login and Change Security is ambiguous.

1135
00:48:16,447 --> 00:48:17,712
Which makes sense.

1136
00:48:17,714 --> 00:48:19,213
I haven't really specified where these

1137
00:48:19,215 --> 00:48:19,914
things are supposed to be.

1138
00:48:19,916 --> 00:48:21,799
Just because I put them on

1139
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,683
the screen doesn't mean that there's an auto layout rule.

1140
00:48:23,686 --> 00:48:25,452
Now, what do I want it to be?

1141
00:48:25,454 --> 00:48:28,621
Well, I kind of want them to be some reasonable distance

1142
00:48:28,623 --> 00:48:30,590
apart so it doesn't look like, you know,

1143
00:48:30,592 --> 00:48:32,058
this is part of the same thing.

1144
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,593
That would look like change security log in is one thing.

1145
00:48:34,595 --> 00:48:37,062
So I want them apart a little bit.

1146
00:48:37,064 --> 00:48:39,664
But otherwise I want them centered on the screen.

1147
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,532
I want the pair of them centered.

1148
00:48:41,534 --> 00:48:44,702
Now, there's no auto layout rule that says that.

1149
00:48:44,704 --> 00:48:47,471
That's too complicated, okay?

1150
00:48:47,473 --> 00:48:50,841
But, I can easily do this with a little creativity, and

1151
00:48:50,843 --> 00:48:51,941
when you start doing auto layout,

1152
00:48:51,943 --> 00:48:54,243
you start realizing, hm, how can I do that?

1153
00:48:54,245 --> 00:48:56,512
Well, I need to be creative in how I'm gonna approach this.

1154
00:48:56,514 --> 00:48:59,748
[NOISE] And in this case what I'm gonna do is

1155
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:04,352
I'm gonna create two little spacer views on the side here.

1156
00:49:04,354 --> 00:49:06,354
And I'm gonna set them to be the same width.

1157
00:49:06,356 --> 00:49:09,357
Can you see how that's gonna make it so

1158
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,126
these two kinda get pushed into the middle?

1159
00:49:12,128 --> 00:49:14,428
Right, by the same amount on each side.

1160
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:16,697
So how would I do that?

1161
00:49:16,698 --> 00:49:18,965
So I'm gonna do that by just grabbing some views,

1162
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:20,750
just generic views,

1163
00:49:20,751 --> 00:49:22,534
okay, this just a generic view like the one you do to

1164
00:49:22,537 --> 00:49:24,337
do your graph view or the face view or whatever.

1165
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:27,506
When I'm working on it here, I'm going to give it

1166
00:49:27,508 --> 00:49:31,876
some background color so I can see the thing, okay,

1167
00:49:31,878 --> 00:49:36,013
now when I'm actually ready to go I will turn that back off.

1168
00:49:36,982 --> 00:49:40,317
And I'm just going to put them in here somewhere, copy and

1169
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,086
paste another one, put it over here somewhere, and

1170
00:49:43,088 --> 00:49:46,756
then I'm just gonna wire these up to how I want them,

1171
00:49:46,758 --> 00:49:49,158
so I want this to kind of be on that edge,

1172
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,859
I want this thing to be on that edge,

1173
00:49:51,995 --> 00:49:55,063
I want these two things to kind of be linked.

1174
00:49:55,065 --> 00:49:56,581
Okay.

1175
00:49:56,582 --> 00:49:58,098
Let's say I'll link their horizontal spacing.

1176
00:49:58,101 --> 00:49:59,066
Now here, I'm going to

1177
00:49:59,068 --> 00:50:00,768
set multiple things between these two.

1178
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:02,836
I'm gonna set the horizontal spacing and

1179
00:50:02,838 --> 00:50:04,904
then notice I'm holding down shift.

1180
00:50:04,906 --> 00:50:06,639
I'm also gonna set the top and

1181
00:50:06,641 --> 00:50:09,608
bottom of this view to match the top and bottom.

1182
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:11,577
Now, there's no base lines because this is not text.

1183
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:12,678
This is just a generic view.

1184
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,512
So I'm gonna move mine up the top and bottom.

1185
00:50:14,514 --> 00:50:16,781
So I can do Shift+click to do that.

1186
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:19,583
Okay. And then same thing over here,

1187
00:50:19,585 --> 00:50:21,752
I'm gonna do the same thing with these two guys.

1188
00:50:21,754 --> 00:50:26,923
I'm gonna set the top whoops, sorry, control drag.

1189
00:50:26,925 --> 00:50:30,492
I'm gonna set the top and bottom horizontal spacing.

1190
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:34,112
Okay.

1191
00:50:34,113 --> 00:50:35,729
Then I said I wanted to make this one and

1192
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:38,733
this one be equal widths.

1193
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:41,369
So I can just do that with control drag as well, so

1194
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,603
I've set that up.

1195
00:50:42,605 --> 00:50:45,505
I want this to be stuck to this edge, trailing space,

1196
00:50:45,507 --> 00:50:48,975
I want this to be stuck to this edge, leading space, and

1197
00:50:48,977 --> 00:50:52,478
I want these two guys to have some horizontal spacing,

1198
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,213
I'm not quite sure how much I want yet, but

1199
00:50:54,215 --> 00:50:56,448
I want some sort of horizontal spacing.

1200
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,885
Now, I've done this, and look, the yellow thing went away.

1201
00:50:59,887 --> 00:51:03,254
It says, okay, I know exactly where to put these things.
这个意思是Xcode已经知道这几个组件的确切位置了。

1202
00:51:03,256 --> 00:51:06,090
But this is really not where I want these put, okay?
但是这个不是我想要的确切位置。

1203
00:51:06,092 --> 00:51:09,260
Because I actually want this spacer right up against this,
因为我希望这个贴着这个，

1204
00:51:09,262 --> 00:51:11,161
and I want this spacer right up against this.
这个贴着这个。


1205
00:51:11,163 --> 00:51:13,663
So I'm gonna go through that same process again of
所以我要再做一次同样的事情来消除那些

1206
00:51:13,665 --> 00:51:15,699
getting rid of the magic number.
魔法数。

1207
00:51:15,701 --> 00:51:17,100
So let's start with this guy.
从这个开始。

1208
00:51:18,136 --> 00:51:20,969
And get rid of his magic numbers in the size inspector,
在尺寸检查器里消除掉它的魔法数。

1209
00:51:20,971 --> 00:51:22,771
so it's got this trailing space here,
来到尾部间距这里，

1210
00:51:22,773 --> 00:51:23,838
let's get rid of that.
消除掉它。

1211
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,407
We want that to be a standard value.
我们希望它是标准值。

1212
00:51:26,409 --> 00:51:29,777
Okay we got this one, we align the bottoms we want those to
到这里，它们应该底部是对齐的，

1213
00:51:29,779 --> 00:51:32,046
be exactly aligned, so we'll do zero.
所以这个应该是0.

1214
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:34,348
Same thing with top we want that exactly aligned, so
顶部应该也是对齐的，

1215
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:37,283
I got rid of all of the magic numbers for this.
这样魔法数就全没了。

1216
00:51:37,285 --> 00:51:38,518
How about this guy?
继续这个。

1217
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,518
Same thing.
还是一样的

1218
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,487
Okay? We want this to be standard value.
这我希望是标准值。

1220
00:51:42,489 --> 00:51:45,657
Usually I always put it to standard value
通常来说我都会选标准值，

1221
00:51:45,659 --> 00:51:47,925
unless standard value is not an option.
但是当标准值不能选时，

1222
00:51:47,927 --> 00:51:49,794
Then I usually pick zero.
我一般就选0.

1223
00:51:49,796 --> 00:51:50,761
Okay? If standard value is
如果标准值不可用，

1224
00:51:50,763 --> 00:51:52,495
not an option I'll just make it zero.
我就把它设成0.

1225
00:51:54,699 --> 00:51:56,565
Then here, a line top.
这里，顶部对齐，

1226
00:51:56,567 --> 00:51:58,033
Let's see. Standard value, nope.
选标准值，不行。

1227
00:51:58,035 --> 00:51:58,700
Let's make it zero.
那就是0吧。

1228
00:52:01,905 --> 00:52:02,970
Okay?

1229
00:52:02,972 --> 00:52:04,338
So, no magic numbers there.
魔法数没了。

1230
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,139
How about this guy?
继续下一个。

1231
00:52:05,141 --> 00:52:06,473
Does he have magic numbers?
这个有魔法数吗？

1232
00:52:06,475 --> 00:52:07,907
Yeah, he has this 87.
有一个87.

1233
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:09,909
That's this difference between these two.
这个跟前边的就不同了。

1234
00:52:11,345 --> 00:52:12,377
That's okay.
这个是可以的。

1235
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,845
This has a magic number here.
这里还有一个魔法数。

1236
00:52:13,847 --> 00:52:15,179
This.
这个

1237
00:52:15,181 --> 00:52:16,847
Hello.

1238
00:52:16,849 --> 00:52:21,151
Standard value.
标准值。

1239
00:52:21,153 --> 00:52:22,569
Okay. So now,

1240
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:23,986
the only magic number we have is this 87,
好了，所以现在唯一的魔法数就是这个87了。

1241
00:52:23,989 --> 00:52:25,855
which is this distance here.
是这两个之间的距离。

1242
00:52:25,857 --> 00:52:28,557
Now, what's really cool about this is you can
这里一个非常酷的东西是，

1243
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,826
double click on this.
你可以双击这里。

1244
00:52:30,828 --> 00:52:32,427
And inspect it right in space.
就可以看到它们的间距。

1245
00:52:32,429 --> 00:52:34,462
So here I'm gonna make it be let's say 50.
我要把它设成50.

1246
00:52:34,464 --> 00:52:37,298
So this is a magic number right here, because there's
这是一个魔法数，因为

1247
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,034
really no standard spacing cuz I'm kinda doing somewhat of

1330
00:56:00,405 --> 00:56:04,640
then that's going to change this to say secure password,

and it's going to start securing it here.

00:56:15,551 --> 00:56:17,318
that when you type, you get the little dots instead of
当是输入的时候，你会看到星号，而不是

1336
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,086
seeing what the person is typing.
明文。

1337
00:56:19,088 --> 00:56:20,620
And then I'm also going to,

in the password label, I'm going to set its text.
密码标签，我要设置它的文本，

1339

1341
00:56:31,881 --> 00:56:33,964
I'm going to set it to just be password.
它就显示 password 就好了。

1342
00:56:35,001 --> 00:56:36,000
Okay. So

1343
00:56:36,001 --> 00:56:37,000
that's this label right here.
就是这个标签。

1344
00:56:37,003 --> 00:56:39,737
I'm going to change that label depending on whether

1345
00:56:39,739 --> 00:56:40,537
it's secure or not.
它的文本。

1346
00:56:40,539 --> 00:56:43,006
Does that make sense?
明白了吗？

1347
00:56:44,209 --> 00:56:45,975

run because now we need to run,

because we're going to be executing our code here.
看看刚才写的代码是不是可以执行。

1350
00:56:53,216 --> 00:56:55,449
Let's hope that when we click that button,

00:58:50,245 --> 00:58:52,912
just a class function here that you can use to log-in.

00:58:57,718 --> 00:59:00,818
Okay. So that's all that's in there.
这就是全部了。

1402
00:59:01,987 --> 00:59:04,921
Let's go use that now, in our controller.
接下来我们要在视图控制器里用它。

1403
00:59:04,923 --> 00:59:07,073
So when I log in,
当我点登陆的时候

1404
00:59:07,074 --> 00:59:09,224
I'm just going to set my set a loggedInUser so I need some
我就需要设置我的 loggedInUser，

1405
00:59:09,227 --> 00:59:13,462
var which is a logged in user, that's basically my model.
所以我要写一个loggedInUser变量，就是我的model。

1406
00:59:13,464 --> 00:59:17,833
LoggedInUser, it's going to be a user.
loggedInUser，user类型。

00:59:20,337 --> 00:59:22,970
Actually it's going to be user optional.

1409
00:59:22,972 --> 00:59:26,040
And I'm going to do my didSet here, and also updateUI.
现在我要写我的didSet，也是 updateUI 。

1410
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:28,942
So if anyone changes my logged in user externally,

1411
00:59:28,944 --> 00:59:32,879
I'll let this be public, then I can update my UI.
这个变量是公共的，然后我可以更新我的UI。

1412
00:59:32,881 --> 00:59:35,715
And finally, say loggedInUser equals User.login.
最后，我要写 loggedInUser ＝ User.login。

1413
00:59:35,717 --> 00:59:38,284
And now I need to give it the login,
现在我要给login参数。

1414
00:59:38,286 --> 00:59:39,852
that's this field right here.
就是输入框里的文本。

1415
00:59:39,854 --> 00:59:43,555
So I'm going to say loginField.text.
所以这里写 loginField.text 。

1416
00:59:44,591 --> 00:59:46,557
But this could be an optional.
这个应该是可选的。

1417
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,858

And the user takes a string.
这是一个字符串参数。

1419
00:59:50,496 --> 00:59:53,263
So, I'm gonna say, okay, well, if it's nil, if
所以我这里写，如果它为空，

1420
00:59:53,265 --> 00:59:56,466
the log-in fill is nil, then just pass blank empty string.
如果输入框的文本为空，我就传入一个空字符串。

1421
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:57,534
Okay?

1422
00:59:57,535 --> 00:59:58,601
That's obviously not gonna log into anything,
很明显这样就不会登陆，

1423
00:59:58,603 --> 01:00:00,102
but that's okay.
但是是允许的。

1424
01:00:00,104 --> 01:00:03,205
And then, same thing here; passwordField.text.

And we'll have empty string there as well, kay?

1426
01:00:08,078 --> 01:00:09,977
So, that's how we're gonna log in, and
这就是我们如何实现登陆的，

1427
01:00:09,979 --> 01:00:11,512
we'll have a loggedInUser.
通过 loggedInUser 变量。

1428
01:00:11,514 --> 01:00:13,714
Once we have our updateUI here that's,

1429
01:00:13,716 --> 01:00:16,383
actually we'll do that a little later.
这个等一会再做。

1430
01:00:16,385 --> 01:00:17,116

So, that's it, okay?
就先这样。

01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,436
their text is gonna get squished down.
它们上面的文字就会被挤压

1544
01:04:36,438 --> 01:04:38,405
So, we do not want them compressed.
所以我们不希望这些元素被压缩

1545
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,573
But this guy, he could be compressed.
但是这个元素，它可以被压缩

1546
01:04:40,575 --> 01:04:42,442
Because it's an image,
因为它是一张图片

1547
01:04:42,443 --> 01:04:44,310
it can just redraw itself at a shorter height.
它可以以一个较短的高度重绘自己

1548
01:04:44,312 --> 01:04:48,313
So, I need to set the resistance to being compressed
所以我需要把阻力设置成可以被压缩

1549
01:04:48,315 --> 01:04:50,548
for this guy to be lower.
对于这个图片，设置地低一些

1550
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:52,917
You've got to lower resistance to being compressed.
把可以被压缩的指数设置地低一些

1551
01:04:52,919 --> 01:04:54,218
So how do I do that?
我该怎么做呢？

1552
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:55,753
You do that in the Size Inspector.
你可以去到 Size INspector

1553
01:04:55,755 --> 01:04:58,655
If you select something, you'll see down here at
如果你选中了某个元素

1554
01:04:58,657 --> 01:05:00,857
the bottom, Content Hugging Priority and
可以看到底部有 Content Hugging Priority

1555
01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:03,693
Content Compression Resistance Priority.
和 Content Compression Resistance Priority

1556
01:05:03,695 --> 01:05:05,061
Okay? Now, these are priorities.
这些就是 Priority

1557
01:05:05,063 --> 01:05:06,695
These are just arbitrary numbers.
它们都用数字代表

1558
01:05:06,697 --> 01:05:10,065
Right now, this one is 750 in the vertical.
这个元素在垂直方向的 Priority 是 750

1559
01:05:10,067 --> 01:05:12,167
This one is also 750.
这个也是 750

1560
01:05:12,169 --> 01:05:13,935
This one is 750.
这个是 750

1561
01:05:13,937 --> 01:05:15,436
This one is 750.
这个是 750

1562
01:05:15,438 --> 01:05:18,205
They all have the same priority to be compressed.
它们的压缩系数都是一样的

1563
01:05:18,207 --> 01:05:20,707
That's why it's complaining, okay?
这就是为什么 Xcode 会有这些警告

1564
01:05:20,709 --> 01:05:23,176
Cuz it doesn't know which one to compress,
因为它不知道该压缩哪一个

1565
01:05:23,178 --> 01:05:24,911
cuz they're all the same.
因为它们的数值都是相同的

1566
01:05:24,912 --> 01:05:26,645
So we can just go back to this one and say, okay well,
现在我们选择这个 ImageView

1567
01:05:26,648 --> 01:05:29,882
we're gonna lower this guy's compression resistance to 700.
我要把它的压缩系数降到 700

1568
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:32,551
Oh, all my problems went away.
所有问题都不见了

1569
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:34,986
Okay? Now I
看到了吗？

1570
01:05:34,987 --> 01:05:36,253
have no yellow thing up here.
这里已经没有黄色的警告了

1571
01:05:36,256 --> 01:05:37,488
This resolved everything.
这一个修改解决了所有问题

1572
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:39,023
I had eight things that were ambiguous.
曾经有8个有歧义的东西

1573
01:05:39,025 --> 01:05:40,290
Now they're all fine.
现在都没有问题了

1574
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:42,158
Why? Because, when we compress now,
为什么呢？因为压缩的时候

1575
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,794
we're gonna know that this is the guy who gets compressed,
系统已经知道该压缩哪个元素了

1576
01:05:46,931 --> 01:05:47,880
and these guys don't.
其它元素就不需要被压缩了

1577
01:05:47,881 --> 01:05:48,830
Okay? So that's what the compression
这就是有关于压缩的事情

1578
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:51,800
thing, and we'll see hugging in in a second, and com, and
稍后我们会讲到 Hugging

1579
01:05:51,802 --> 01:05:54,469
more compression a little later, okay?
和更多与 Compression 相关的

1580
01:05:54,471 --> 01:05:55,403
So that's what these are about.
这就是相关的东西

1581
01:05:55,405 --> 01:05:56,237
A lot of people are, like,
许多人会说

1582
01:05:56,238 --> 01:05:57,070
well, I don't understand these.
我不理解这些东西

1583
01:05:57,073 --> 01:05:57,938
But it's quite simple.
但是这些概念真的很简单

1584
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:59,606
It's just how much is this view,
它只是一个与其它 view 对比的值

1585
01:05:59,608 --> 01:06:02,809
compared to other views, resisting being compressed?
数值越大代表越不希望被压缩

1586
01:06:02,811 --> 01:06:04,577
And hugging priority is,
Hugging Priority 是

1587
01:06:04,579 --> 01:06:06,712
how much does it want to be its size?
它有多希望变得更小

1588
01:06:06,714 --> 01:06:09,014
How much does it want to be small, in other words?
换句话说，你到底想不想变小

1589
01:06:09,016 --> 01:06:12,484
So, like this guy always, that button always wants to
好比这个按钮

1590
01:06:12,486 --> 01:06:15,520
be only big enough to hold the login.
它总是希望能装下 Login 这几个字符

1591
01:06:15,522 --> 01:06:18,923
It does not want to be really tall or really wide.
它不希望变得更高或更宽

1592
01:06:18,925 --> 01:06:19,990
It wants to hug.
它希望 Hug

1593
01:06:19,992 --> 01:06:22,226
So, it has a high hugging priority.
所以它的 Hugging Priority 会很高

1594
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:25,762
Other things, they might not care if they get bigger.
其他的元素，它们不在乎是否变得更大

1595
01:06:25,764 --> 01:06:26,713
Okay?
懂了吗？

1596
01:06:26,714 --> 01:06:27,663
Like this thing right here,
就像它

1597
01:06:27,665 --> 01:06:29,765
it really wants to hug vertically.
它总是希望在垂直方向 Hug

1598
01:06:29,767 --> 01:06:32,067
It doesn't mind if it gets stretched out horizontally.
它不在乎自己是否在横向被拉抻

1599
01:06:33,203 --> 01:06:33,768
All right?
懂了吗？

1600
01:06:34,971 --> 01:06:35,669
Okay.
好的

1601
01:06:35,671 --> 01:06:37,070
So, that's that.
就是这样

1602
01:06:37,072 --> 01:06:41,474
Now, let's go to, what are we going to do next here?
下一步应该做什么呢？

1603
01:06:41,476 --> 01:06:44,243
Let's add a couple more fields.
我们再添加几个 Text Field

1604
01:06:44,245 --> 01:06:47,012
That name, remember we had the name and the company?
还记得 name 和 company 吗？

1605
01:06:47,014 --> 01:06:49,181
Let's go add those and see what happens here.
把这些添加上去，看看会发生什么

1606
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:52,784
So those are going to be text fields.
它们都是 Text Field

1607
01:06:52,786 --> 01:06:54,752
So they're labels rather, they're right here at the top.
它们是 Label，在顶部这里

1608
01:06:54,754 --> 01:06:56,387
So I'm just going to put these out here,
所以我们要把它们放在这里

1609
01:06:56,389 --> 01:06:57,654
grab a couple of these.
拽几个 Label

1610
01:06:57,656 --> 01:06:59,756
We'll make this one be name.
把这个改成 Name

1611
01:06:59,758 --> 01:07:02,492
We'll make this one be the company.
把这个改成 Company

1612
01:07:02,494 --> 01:07:05,161
All right, now where do I want these to be located?
我应该把它们放到哪里呢？

1613
01:07:05,163 --> 01:07:08,530
Well, I kind of want this to be right here.
我想把它放到这里

1614
01:07:08,532 --> 01:07:11,099
I really want it to be kind of like right here.
就是放在这里

1615
01:07:11,101 --> 01:07:13,068
Okay, not perfectly in the middle because I
不是放在最中间

1616
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,502
am gonna put company right here.
因为我想把 Company 放在这里

1617
01:07:14,504 --> 01:07:17,371
So now it would be kind of offset down.
稍稍往下面偏移一点

1618
01:07:17,373 --> 01:07:19,640
But I guess I can say all right,
我觉得这还可以

1619
01:07:19,642 --> 01:07:21,174
I'll make these two things.
我可以处理好这两个

1620
01:07:21,176 --> 01:07:23,476
I'll have their horizontal spacing and
我会让它们 Horizontal Spacing

1621
01:07:23,478 --> 01:07:25,445
their Center Y's matched up.
并且把 Center Y 匹配起来

1622
01:07:25,447 --> 01:07:26,579
The centers vertically.
垂直部分的中央

1623
01:07:27,915 --> 01:07:31,049
It's kinda not exactly what I want, but it's close.
这可能有点不是我想要的，但是已经非常接近了

1624
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:34,819
And then this guy, I will have his vertical spacing, and
对于这个 Label，我要让它 Vertical Spacing

1625
01:07:34,821 --> 01:07:38,089
his left edge lined up with the name.
并且 Left Edge 和 Name 连接起来

1626
01:07:38,091 --> 01:07:38,957
Right?
对吧？

1627
01:07:38,958 --> 01:07:39,824
That's pretty much what I want.
这大体上是我想要的

1628
01:07:39,826 --> 01:07:41,358
So that's not bad, but
还不错

1629
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,860
really I don't want this lined up with the middle here.
但是我不想让它和中间排成一行

1630
01:07:43,862 --> 01:07:46,730
I want the bottom of this lined up with the middle.
我想让它的底部和中间排成一行

1631
01:07:46,732 --> 01:07:48,064
So how can I do that?
我怎么才能做到呢？

1632
01:07:48,066 --> 01:07:49,432
Okay, pay attention now.
现在集中注意力

1633
01:07:49,434 --> 01:07:51,066
It's very important to understand, because now
理解这部分很重要

1634
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:53,568
we're gonna start looking at how these constraints work.
因为我们要开始看看这些 Constraint 是怎么工作的

1635
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,470
So I'm gonna click on this constraint,
我先点击这个 Constraint

1636
01:07:55,472 --> 01:07:58,773
which causes me to inspect it here in the Inspector.
在 Inspector 中，我就可以对其进行检查

1637
01:07:58,775 --> 01:07:59,941
Okay? This is
OK?

1638
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:01,108
what a constraint looks like.
这就是一个 Constraint

1639
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:04,111
Notice the constraint has two items, a first item and
注意看这里的 Constraint 有两个 item

1640
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:04,978
a second item.
First Item 和 Second Item

1641
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:10,917
And, for each item, it says something about that item,
对于每一个 Item，都有一些关于 Item 的信息

1642
01:08:10,919 --> 01:08:15,654
like its center, or its bottom, or its top.
例如它的中间，底部或者顶部

1643
01:08:15,656 --> 01:08:17,456
Okay? If it had text,
如果上面有文字

1644
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:19,124
it could be base lines.
Baseline 也可以选择

1645
01:08:19,126 --> 01:08:20,792
All right?
懂了吗？

1646
01:08:20,793 --> 01:08:22,459
So, each of them has something like that.
每一个都有类似的东西

1647
01:08:22,462 --> 01:08:23,994
And then, it has a relationship between them,
然后，它还有一个两个 Item 之间的关系

1648
01:08:23,996 --> 01:08:25,929
which could be equal, less than or
这个关系可是相等，小于或等于

1649
01:08:25,931 --> 01:08:28,298
equal, or greater than or equal.
大于或等于

1650
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:31,901
So right now I have the center of this Stanford thing
现在，我使得 Standford 图标的中间和

1651
01:08:31,903 --> 01:08:34,270
equal to the center of the name thing.
Name 的中间相等

1652
01:08:34,272 --> 01:08:38,007
But it's perfectly fine for me to say I want the center of
对于我来说

1653
01:08:38,009 --> 01:08:41,843
the Stanford thing to match the bottom of the name thing.
把这个图标的中间和 Name 的底部对齐也是可以的

1654
01:08:41,845 --> 01:08:43,945
Okay?
OK？

1655
01:08:43,947 --> 01:08:45,947
Understand that?
懂了吗？

1656
01:08:45,949 --> 01:08:48,249
And then, down here you have this constant.
在这里，有一个 Constant

1657
01:08:48,251 --> 01:08:49,200
Okay?
OK？

1658
01:08:49,201 --> 01:08:50,150
The constants, there's two constants.
这里有两个常数

1659
01:08:50,152 --> 01:08:52,319
One is a multiplier, and one is a constant.
一个是 Multiplier 一个是 Constant

1660
01:08:52,321 --> 01:08:54,488
Okay?
OK?

1661
01:08:54,489 --> 01:08:56,656
So the constant is always added onto the end,
Constant 总是加在最后

1662
01:08:56,658 --> 01:08:59,459
and the multiplier is going to multiply the things that
Multiplier 的作用是

1663
01:08:59,461 --> 01:09:01,127
are being compared.
把比较的地方相乘

1664
01:09:01,129 --> 01:09:04,430
So it really doesn't make sense too much to multiply.
其实相乘没什么意义

1665
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:06,465
But it kind of does.
但是也有点意义

1666
01:09:06,466 --> 01:09:08,499
Watch if I do four to one ratio.
我在这里填入 4:1

1667
01:09:08,502 --> 01:09:10,869
It's putting this bottom of this
它把它底部的设置成了

1668
01:09:12,005 --> 01:09:16,073
the ratio of four to one of the size of here.
这里大小的四倍

1669
01:09:16,075 --> 01:09:16,807
Okay? And
OK?

1670
01:09:16,809 --> 01:09:20,276
this can also be like, 0.5.
这里也可以填 0.5

1671
01:09:20,278 --> 01:09:21,861
Okay.
好的

1672
01:09:21,862 --> 01:09:23,445
Which is really tiny, so tiny that it's one.
0.5 有点小

1673
01:09:23,448 --> 01:09:24,246
Let's say two.
试试2

1674
01:09:25,249 --> 01:09:26,781
All right? So these can be numbers, or
这里可以填数字

1675
01:09:26,783 --> 01:09:29,000
they can be ratios.
也可以填比率

1676
01:09:29,001 --> 01:09:31,218
And then the constant is an amount added to it, like 50.
Constant 是增加的数量，例如50

1677
01:09:31,221 --> 01:09:33,954
Okay, so I've just added fixed 50 pixels.
在这里添加了50个像素

1678
01:09:33,956 --> 01:09:36,473
So it's just always added.
它总是在原有的基础上添加

1679
01:09:36,474 --> 01:09:38,991
So constant is always added, multiplier is multiplied.
Constant 总是添加，Multiplier 就是相乘

1680
01:09:38,994 --> 01:09:42,495
All constraints are this way, every single one.
每一个 Constraint 都是这样的

1681
01:09:42,497 --> 01:09:43,596
Okay? And,
OK?

1682
01:09:43,598 --> 01:09:46,132
some make sense with center or top bottom.
有一些对于 Center Top Bottom 有意义

1683
01:09:46,134 --> 01:09:48,667
Some of them make sense with width and height.
而有一些是 Width 和 Height 有意义

1684
01:09:48,669 --> 01:09:50,402
And when we do one in code,
当我们在代码里实现 Constraint 的时候

1685
01:09:50,403 --> 01:09:52,136
you're gonna see we're gonna do width and height.
你会看到，我们会处理 Width 和 Height

1686
01:09:52,139 --> 01:09:55,473
You know, but they're still in the same form.
但是它们的形式都是相同的

1687
01:09:55,475 --> 01:09:57,142
They always have the same form.
他们总是有相同的形式

1688
01:09:57,143 --> 01:09:58,810
That's why there's only one constructor for
这就是为什么在代码中

1689
01:09:58,812 --> 01:10:00,678
these layout constraint in the code.
这个 Layout Constraint 只有一个 Constructor（构造器）

1690
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,980
Okay, and it just takes all of these things.
它把所有这些当做参数

1691
01:10:02,982 --> 01:10:06,149
The constant, the multiplier the first item.
Constant，Multiplier，First Item

1692
01:10:06,151 --> 01:10:07,250
Which thing on the first item?
哪个元素是 First Item

1693
01:10:07,252 --> 01:10:08,117
The relationship.
Relationship

1694
01:10:08,119 --> 01:10:10,086
And the second item, the second, and
Second Item

1695
01:10:10,088 --> 01:10:12,287
the thing on that, okay?
和 Second Item 上面的元素

1696
01:10:12,289 --> 01:10:13,388
So we're gonna see that.
我们以后会看到的

1697
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:15,256
So, lets see if this worked.
看看我们所做的有没有效果

1698
01:10:15,258 --> 01:10:18,326
Just for fun let's go ahead and go back to our code, and
回到代码里

1699
01:10:18,328 --> 01:10:19,794
why are these things up.
把这些东西连接起来

1700
01:10:21,797 --> 01:10:24,097
Okay, so Ctrl+Drag.
按住 Ctrl 拖动鼠标

1701
01:10:24,099 --> 01:10:26,466
That's alright, from the name.
从 Name

1702
01:10:26,468 --> 01:10:29,569
oops, Undo, okay.
搞错了

1703
01:10:29,571 --> 01:10:31,437
Ctrl+Drag from the name.
从 Name

1704
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:34,239
That is our Name Label and we'll go and
起名为 nameLabel

1705
01:10:34,241 --> 01:10:36,875
Ctrl+Drag from the company here.
同样方法

1706
01:10:36,877 --> 01:10:39,611
That is our Company Label.
把 Company 设置好

1707
01:10:39,613 --> 01:10:40,311
All right.
好的

1708
01:10:40,313 --> 01:10:41,812
And in our Update UI,
在 UpdateUI 里面

1709
01:10:41,814 --> 01:10:45,349
sorry about the width here, let's do this.
这有点挡住了，把它收回去点

1710
01:10:45,351 --> 01:10:49,786
In our Update UI here, we are going to update those.
在 UpdateUI 里面，我们来更新这两个 Label

1711
01:10:49,788 --> 01:10:54,824
So we'll just say that our Name Label that text,
把 nameLabel 的 text 

1712
01:10:54,826 --> 01:10:58,360
equals our logged in user.
设置为 loggedInUser?

1713
01:10:58,362 --> 01:11:00,062
And if our logged in user is nil,
如果 loggedInUser 是 nil

1714
01:11:00,064 --> 01:11:02,530
then we'll just set the text to be nil as well.
把 text 设置为 nil 就可以了

1715
01:11:02,532 --> 01:11:04,799
So I'm using optional chaining there.
所以在这里我使用了可选链

1716
01:11:04,801 --> 01:11:06,901
But that's the name of the person.
这就是登陆者的名字

1717
01:11:06,903 --> 01:11:10,871
And then, our company label's text equals the logged in
然后，Company Label 的 text

1718
01:11:10,873 --> 01:11:12,205
user's company.
等于 loggedInUser?.company

1719
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:14,774
Okay? Let's also set
OK?

1720
01:11:14,776 --> 01:11:16,308
that image view right there.
在这里也把 imageView 给设置好

1721
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:16,875
Okay?
OK?

1722
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:20,545
So we'll Ctrl+Drag from the image view
按住 Ctrl 拖动 imageView

1723
01:11:20,547 --> 01:11:22,113
that's just like any other thing.
就像之前做的一样

1724
01:11:22,115 --> 01:11:24,715
I can Ctrl+Drag this thing over, so let's do that.
我可以拖动它

1725
01:11:24,717 --> 01:11:27,217
I'm gonna call it the Image View.
把它起名为 imageView

1726
01:11:27,219 --> 01:11:29,970
Okay. And
OK.

1727
01:11:29,971 --> 01:11:32,722
we'll set that as well in our Update UI.
我们也要在 UpdateUI 里更新它

1728
01:11:32,724 --> 01:11:38,227
Here by saying imageview.image equals the logged in
把这里的 imageView.image 设置为

1729
01:11:38,229 --> 01:11:40,595
user's image.
登陆用户的 image

1730
01:11:40,597 --> 01:11:41,863
Unfortunately, this is not gonna work.
但是，这不会起作用

1731
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:44,132
And why is this not gonna work?
它为什么不起作用呢？

1732
01:11:44,134 --> 01:11:47,001
Because Image is not defined in User.
因为 User 中没有定义 image

1733
01:11:47,003 --> 01:11:48,168
If we go look at User.
如果我们查看一下 User 类

1734
01:11:52,407 --> 01:11:56,442
Okay, user can't have an image because it's a model.
User 不能拥有 image，因为它是 model

1735
01:11:56,444 --> 01:11:57,810
It doesn't have any UI kit.
它没有导入 UIKit

1736
01:11:57,812 --> 01:11:58,777
There's no UI.
这里没有 UI

1737
01:11:58,779 --> 01:12:00,178
And UI image is a UI thing.
UIImage 是一个 UI 元素

1738
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:01,012
Okay.
OK.

1739
01:12:01,014 --> 01:12:02,646
So we can't even model.
所以 model 里不能有它

1740
01:12:02,648 --> 01:12:05,683
But that doesn't stop us from having an image
但是这也不能组织我们拥有 image 这个 property

1741
01:12:05,685 --> 01:12:11,855
property MUser, because we can use extensions.
因为我们可以使用 extension

1742
01:12:11,857 --> 01:12:13,840
Okay.
OK

1743
01:12:13,841 --> 01:12:15,824
So here I'm gonna make an extension to User.
所以这里，我给 User 添加一个 extension

1744
01:12:16,761 --> 01:12:19,128
Okay, it's gonna be a var called image.
一个叫 image 的变量

1745
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:23,565
It's gonna be a UIImage, UIImage, but I'm adding this
类型是 UIImage

1746
01:12:23,567 --> 01:12:27,135
in my controller so that's fine because, it's extending
我把它放到 controller 里

1747
01:12:27,137 --> 01:12:29,337
my model but it's not actually touching my model.
它扩展了我的 model，但是没有接触我的 model

1748
01:12:29,339 --> 01:12:32,106
My model is still purely fine.
model 还是没问题的

1749
01:12:32,108 --> 01:12:36,343
And to do this, I'm just gonna return basically a UIImage,
为了实现功能，在这里返回一个 UIImage

1750
01:12:36,345 --> 01:12:39,479
that is named the user's login.
name 是 User 中的 login

1751
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:42,515
Now notice, I can refer to login here because this
看到了吗，我可以获取到 login

1752
01:12:42,517 --> 01:12:43,215
is user.
因为我们在 User 类中

1753
01:12:43,217 --> 01:12:44,683
This is on user, so
这是对 User 的扩展

1754
01:12:44,685 --> 01:12:49,220
login is a user thing, so I can refer to that, 'kay.
所以我可以获取到

1755
01:12:49,222 --> 01:12:52,656
But this is saying no, because this might return nil.
但是这有一个错误，因为它也许会返回 nil

1756
01:12:52,658 --> 01:12:54,324
So I'm gonna say.
我会说

1757
01:12:54,326 --> 01:12:56,426
If I can get let the image equal that,.
如果我能获取到 image

1758
01:13:01,399 --> 01:13:03,833
Then, I will return it.
我就返回它

1759
01:13:05,202 --> 01:13:12,107
Otherwise, I will return a UI image of some unknown user.
否则我就返回一个未知用户的 UIImage 

1760
01:13:12,109 --> 01:13:13,574
I have. A thing there I
在这里

1761
01:13:13,576 --> 01:13:15,042
put in there called, unknown user.
我输入 unknown_user

1762
01:13:15,044 --> 01:13:17,978
That's just an image that I put there.
这是一张图片的名字

1763
01:13:20,449 --> 01:13:23,316
And this, I'm gonna make this optional so
我把它变成 optional

1764
01:13:23,318 --> 01:13:25,851
the whole thing can return optional.
所以内部就可以返回 optional

1765
01:13:25,853 --> 01:13:27,353
Okay?
OK?

1766
01:13:27,355 --> 01:13:30,355
So now, this is implemented.
现在，这个已经实现完毕了

1767
01:13:30,357 --> 01:13:31,957
This might return nill but
这个也许会返回 nil

1768
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:33,558
that's okay, because this is allowed to be nill.
但是这也没问题，因为这个允许是 nil 的

1769
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,492
And all is well.
万事俱备

1770
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:35,977
So let's go take a look,
我们运行程序来看一下

1771
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:37,461
now we should have our full UI functioning here.
所有 UI 的功能都已经实现了

1772
01:13:38,564 --> 01:13:39,896
Let's go on our iPhone here.
用 iPhone 运行一下

1773
01:13:39,898 --> 01:13:47,437
Oh, I know, right here,
哦，我知道了

1774
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:53,208
okay, run, okay, here it is, so let's log in as madbum.
运行一下，我们用 madbum 登陆

1775
01:13:54,611 --> 01:13:56,077
And log in, and there we go.
登陆完毕

1776
01:13:56,079 --> 01:13:57,612
Oh, that looks terrible.
这看起来太糟糕了

1777
01:13:59,082 --> 01:14:00,447
What's going on here?
到底发生了什么？

1778
01:14:00,449 --> 01:14:04,718
Look at how it stretched this thing out, okay?
这个东西被拉抻开了

1779
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,886
I want this hugging.
我希望它是 Hug 的

1780
01:14:06,888 --> 01:14:07,586
I don't like this.
我不希望这样

1781
01:14:07,588 --> 01:14:09,221
This is not hugging, okay?
它没有 Hug

1782
01:14:09,223 --> 01:14:10,655
But there's another problem too,
这里也有个问题

1783
01:14:10,657 --> 01:14:12,374
we'll look at this in a second.
我们稍后再看

1784
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:14,092
But let's look at it this way, though.
我们旋转一下屏幕

1785
01:14:14,094 --> 01:14:15,426
Same thing, it's no good.
同样地，效果很不好

1786
01:14:16,429 --> 01:14:17,795
Okay? So, we're getting close.
不过已经很接近了

1787
01:14:17,797 --> 01:14:19,697
Why is this happening?
为什么会这样呢？

1788
01:14:19,698 --> 01:14:21,598
Well, the reason that this is happening is because we have
发生这件事的原因是

1789
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,834
all these things attached to each other, and, so
我们把这些 view 都相互依附在一起

1790
01:14:24,836 --> 01:14:27,103
we can fix this in two ways, actually.
其实我们可以通过两种方式修复

1791
01:14:27,105 --> 01:14:32,408
One way is I can go here, and change this guy,
一种是，去到这里，改变它

1792
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:35,310
who's hugging priority can just be less so
把它的 Hugging Priority 调低

1793
01:14:35,312 --> 01:14:37,712
that these guys will be more likely to hug.
所以其他这些就更可能 Hug

1794
01:14:37,714 --> 01:14:38,697
Okay.
OK.

1795
01:14:38,698 --> 01:14:39,681
Down on their text.
在它们的 text 下面

1796
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:43,084
So I'm gonna set this guy's vertical hugging priority
所以我要设置它的 Vertical Hugging Priority

1797
01:14:43,086 --> 01:14:44,184
down to let's say 200.
把它调到 200

1798
01:14:44,186 --> 01:14:47,087
The rest of these are at say, 250.
剩下的这些还是 250

1799
01:14:47,089 --> 01:14:49,122
Okay, these are all at 250.
它们都是 250

1800
01:14:49,124 --> 01:14:51,024
I'm gonna set mine down to 200.
我把它调低到 200

1801
01:14:51,026 --> 01:14:51,824
Okay.
好的。

1802
01:14:52,793 --> 01:14:56,361
So we run, let's log in as mad mom again.
我们再次以madbum登陆。

1803
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:02,367
There we go, okay, so it didn't squish this,
走起，很好，这个没被压扁了，

1804
01:15:02,369 --> 01:15:04,802
although wow, now it's stretched this thing way up.
但是，下面的图片被拉伸了。

1805
01:15:04,804 --> 01:15:07,204
I don't really like that either.
我不希望这样。

1806
01:15:07,206 --> 01:15:07,904
Okay?
明白吗？

1807
01:15:07,906 --> 01:15:09,406
So why is that happening?
那这是为什么呢?

1808
01:15:09,408 --> 01:15:12,675
Well that's happening because of this constraint right here.
这是因为这个约束。

1809
01:15:12,677 --> 01:15:14,677
This constraint says,
这个约束说，

1810
01:15:14,678 --> 01:15:16,678
that the distance from the top of the image to the bottom of
从图片顶部到登陆按钮底部的距离

1811
01:15:16,681 --> 01:15:18,914
here has to equal.
必须相等于。

1812
01:15:18,916 --> 01:15:20,215
The standard value equal.
标准值。

1813
01:15:20,217 --> 01:15:22,267
I don't want equal.
但我不想等于一个确定的值。

1814
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:24,318
I'm gonna say, if it's greater than or equal, that's fine.
我只需要，大于或等于就可以了。

1815
01:15:25,722 --> 01:15:27,288
Okay? So this is where you
明白吗？这种情况下

1816
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:28,855
would use a greater than or equals, because this spacing,
就可以用到大于或等于选项，因为这个距离，

1817
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:31,091
I just want to make sure it doesn't smash into it.
我只需要确保图片不和按钮重叠就行。

1818
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:32,625
But if it's smaller, that's okay.
所以图片小一点也是没问题的。

1819
01:15:32,627 --> 01:15:33,993
I don't mind that.
我并不在意。

1820
01:15:35,963 --> 01:15:36,962
All right. So now, let's try madbum.
好的，我们再次登陆。

1821
01:15:36,964 --> 01:15:37,529
Madbum.
输入madbum

1822
01:15:41,501 --> 01:15:43,534
Okay, perfect, so now it's doing that, and
很好，完美解决，看这里，而且

1823
01:15:43,536 --> 01:15:46,536
over here, oops, over this way, working fine.
在横屏模式下，同样没问题。

1824
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,971
Okay?
看到没？

1825
01:15:48,973 --> 01:15:50,957
So we're getting good,
事情很顺利，

1826
01:15:50,958 --> 01:15:52,942
there's only really two things left that are problems in
整个程序就只剩下

1827
01:15:52,944 --> 01:15:55,027
this whole thing,
两个问题了，

1828
01:15:55,028 --> 01:15:57,111
one is this guy getting smashed off, gotta fix that.
一个是这两个文本的内容没有显示完整，我们来修复它。

1829
01:15:57,114 --> 01:15:58,447
And we fix that.
来解决这个问题。

1830
01:15:58,449 --> 01:15:59,614
You already know how to fix that.
你应该知道如何解决这个问题了

1831
01:15:59,616 --> 01:16:01,549
I'm just gonna take this, and make it so
只需要选中它，然后

1832
01:16:01,551 --> 01:16:04,452
that this thing hooks to this edge.
和父视图的边界关联起来。

1833
01:16:04,454 --> 01:16:08,088
And same thing with this thing hooking to this guy's edge.
这个标签也是一样。

1834
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:11,224
And again, I don't want them to be anything but
同样，我需要把他们的值设置为

1835
01:16:11,226 --> 01:16:12,392
a standard value here.
标准值。

1836
01:16:12,394 --> 01:16:14,193
So I'm gonna have this one be zero.
选这个或者0.

1837
01:16:16,397 --> 01:16:17,963
And same thing with this one right here.
这个也是一样。

1838
01:16:17,965 --> 01:16:19,264
I don't like this.
我不想要这个。

1839
01:16:20,633 --> 01:16:21,565
Nonstandard values.
非标准值。

1840
01:16:21,567 --> 01:16:23,767
In fact, I've got a couple of them
事实上，前面还有很多

1841
01:16:23,768 --> 01:16:25,968
left over from previous things here, so let's fix these.
这样的问题需要修复。

1842
01:16:25,971 --> 01:16:29,506
Standard Values.
标准值。

1843
01:16:29,508 --> 01:16:30,506
Okay?
明白吗？

1844
01:16:30,508 --> 01:16:31,574
All right.
好的。

1845
01:16:31,576 --> 01:16:32,641
Everything look good there?
现在看起来都正常了。

1846
01:16:32,643 --> 01:16:33,408
No magic numbers?
没有 magic numbers吧？

1847
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:34,275
Oh, here's the magic number.
oh， 这里还有一个。

1848
01:16:34,277 --> 01:16:35,009
Let's get rid of that.
改掉它。

1849
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:37,745
Standard Value.
标准值。

1850
01:16:39,148 --> 01:16:41,548
That it, okay, got all those.
好的，全部修改了。

1851
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:43,216
Everything looks fine, it moved.
看起来很不错。

1852
01:16:43,218 --> 01:16:45,317
So now, we should be all fixed and ready to go.
现在，应该都修改正确了，可以测试了。

1853
01:16:45,319 --> 01:16:50,022
Alright, madbum again.
好的，再次登录。

1854
01:16:50,024 --> 01:16:52,791
Secure this time, don't want you to know madbum's password.
换成安全状态，不想让你看到密码。

1855
01:16:53,993 --> 01:16:56,761
Okay, looking good, oh, still didn't quite work.
好的，看起来很好，但是，好像还是有问题。

1856
01:16:56,763 --> 01:17:00,697
We got the name but why did this thing.
姓名标签很正常，但是下面这个。

1857
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:01,798
Not do that.
不对。

1858
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:02,865
What's going on there?
这是怎么回事？

1859
01:17:02,867 --> 01:17:04,266
Same circle Giants got put up.
同样的问题有发生了。

1860
01:17:04,268 --> 01:17:08,270
The reason there is this guy's hogging priority is too
原因是这个标签的hugging 优先级别太

1861
01:17:08,272 --> 01:17:10,638
low, okay.
低了。

1862
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,373
I'm sorry, his compression resistance, I mean,
很抱歉，是compression resistance值才对，

1863
01:17:12,375 --> 01:17:14,075
is too low.
太低了。

1864
01:17:14,076 --> 01:17:15,776
He's allowing himself to be compressed.
它允许自己被挤压。

1865
01:17:15,778 --> 01:17:17,111
Okay.
好的。

1866
01:17:17,112 --> 01:17:18,445
So here, we need to have the horizontal compression
这里，我们需要提高它的水平

1867
01:17:18,447 --> 01:17:20,247
resistance of this guy be higher.
resistance值。

1868
01:17:20,249 --> 01:17:21,381
So I'm gonna set it to 800.
就设置为800.

1869
01:17:21,383 --> 01:17:22,882
Doesn't really matter what we set,
具体设置成多大并不是很重要，

1870
01:17:22,884 --> 01:17:24,216
as long as it's higher than.
只要大于

1871
01:17:24,218 --> 01:17:27,119
The other things, like this one, which is 750, so
其他视图的值，比如这个，它是750，

1872
01:17:27,121 --> 01:17:31,990
let's set this guy's also, oops, it's compression to 800.
把这个也设置为800.

1873
01:17:31,992 --> 01:17:35,926
Okay, so that prevents them from being compressed down so
这样一来，就可以避免他们被挤压

1874
01:17:35,928 --> 01:17:37,528
that their text won't show.
 而无法完整显示文本了。

1875
01:17:37,530 --> 01:17:40,130
Okay.
好的。

1876
01:17:40,132 --> 01:17:46,235
Oh, well, that's not so good.
oh，情况不妙。

1877
01:17:46,237 --> 01:17:49,138
Okay, so we fixed one problem, we introduces another one.
看，我们解决了一个问题，又来了另一个。

1878
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:50,807
So we certainly-
所以实际上

1879
01:17:50,808 --> 01:17:52,475
There are two problems with this,
这里有两个问题，

1880
01:17:52,476 --> 01:17:54,143
actually, number one, this is not the right aspect ratio.
首先，图片的宽高比例不对。

1881
01:17:54,145 --> 01:17:55,610
This is not what the Giants logo looks like,
Giants logo可不是这样的，

1882
01:17:55,612 --> 01:17:57,245
you can barely even tell it's the Giants.
你甚至都认不出来。

1883
01:17:57,247 --> 01:18:00,481
And number two is, it's way too small, okay?
问题二，太小了，不是吗？

1884
01:18:00,483 --> 01:18:03,784
Look at all this empty space I've got up here, okay, so
看上面的空白空间。

1885
01:18:03,786 --> 01:18:05,085
we've got two things to fix here.
所以还有两个问题解决后

1886
01:18:05,087 --> 01:18:06,787
And then we're done.
就完成了。

1887
01:18:06,789 --> 01:18:09,889
One is make this aspect ratio be enforced, and
一个是修正图片的宽高比问题，

1888
01:18:09,891 --> 01:18:13,026
another one is put this in the right space.
另一个是将它放到正确的位置。

1889
01:18:13,028 --> 01:18:16,595
In this size class which is I got a lot of vertical space.
在这个size class 我们有充足的垂直空间。

1890
01:18:16,597 --> 01:18:20,198
So, lets go ahead and fix the aspect ratio one first.
我们先修复图宽高比的问题。

1891
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,867
You know that one.
你可能会想。

1892
01:18:22,869 --> 01:18:25,236
We'd like to be able to just go here and
我们可以到这里

1893
01:18:25,238 --> 01:18:27,805
add some kind of constraint, but we can't actually do that.
加一些约束就好了，但事实上，不可以。

1894
01:18:27,807 --> 01:18:30,708
And that's because if you remember, when we look
因为，不知道你是否记得

1895
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:35,845
at a constraint, its constant and multiplier are constants.
一个约束的的constant和multiplier值是常量。

1896
01:18:35,847 --> 01:18:38,348
And every time we get a new image,
每次图片更新的时候，

1897
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:40,216
it has a different aspect ratio.
它的宽高比不同。

1898
01:18:41,318 --> 01:18:42,718
Okay?
明白吗？

1899
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,119
So, unless we wanted to force everyone's image to
除非我们限制每个图片

1900
01:18:44,121 --> 01:18:46,788
be the same aspect ratio, we need code to
的宽高比相同，不然的话，我们需要

1901
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:49,791
do this because we have to calculate that aspect ratio.
在代码中来计算这个宽高比才行。

1902
01:18:49,793 --> 01:18:50,858
So, this is what that looks like.
所以，仔细看好了。

1903
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:53,027
I'm gonna go through this pretty fast because
我会以非常快的速度演示因为

1904
01:18:53,029 --> 01:18:56,730
we're over time already, so you can watch it here.
时间不多了，看这里。

1905
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:58,765
So, I'm gonna do this like this.
我会这样做。

1906
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:00,400
I'm gonna create a new var,
新建一个变量，

1907
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:04,503
which is an aspectRatioConstraint(), and
命名为aspectRatioConstraint

1908
01:19:04,505 --> 01:19:07,706
it's going to be of type NSLayoutConstraint.
类型为NSLayoutConstraint

1909
01:19:07,708 --> 01:19:10,575
This is the type of those constraints.
这是所有约束的类型。

1910
01:19:10,577 --> 01:19:13,845
All those constraints in there it is of this type, okay.
所有的约束都是这个类型，是的。

1911
01:19:13,847 --> 01:19:17,448
Now, I'm gonna create another var called image, UIImage.
现在创建另一个变量，叫做image

1912
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:21,851
And it can be optional, it's fine.
可以为空，所以设置为optional类型。

1913
01:19:21,853 --> 01:19:24,253
And it's just gonna be a computed property,
这将使一个computed property，

1914
01:19:24,255 --> 01:19:28,424
where I'm gonna get and set my image views properties.
我会在其中设置和获取我的image view视图。

1915
01:19:28,426 --> 01:19:31,126
So I'm really just gonna return imageView.image,
我只需要返回 imageView.image,

1916
01:19:31,128 --> 01:19:32,327
I'm gonna set her.
设置她。

1917
01:19:32,329 --> 01:19:33,594
I'm just going to set it.
设置好就可以了。

1918
01:19:33,596 --> 01:19:35,896
Let's go to wide here.
这边加宽一点。

1919
01:19:35,898 --> 01:19:37,965
Wide mode.
更宽一点。

1920
01:19:41,203 --> 01:19:42,435
Okay, in the center,
好的，在setter方法里面，

1921
01:19:42,437 --> 01:19:45,238
I'm just gonna set it imageView.image = image.
我只需要设置imageView.image = image.

1922
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,873
Now, why am I creating this little computer property?
那么，我为什么创建这个computed property？

1923
01:19:47,875 --> 01:19:51,443
Because every time I set my imageView's image I
因为每当我设置imageView的image的时候

1924
01:19:51,445 --> 01:19:55,547
want to update this aspect ration constraint, okay.
我需要更新图片的宽高比例约束，明白？

1925
01:19:55,549 --> 01:19:58,082
So, if I can let this constrained view,
所以，如果imageView不为空

1926
01:19:58,084 --> 01:20:00,785
this is the view I'm trying to constrain,
就是我想添加约束的视图，

1927
01:20:00,787 --> 01:20:02,353
which is the image view.
也就是imageView。

1928
01:20:02,355 --> 01:20:04,054
If I can let it equal something.
如果我可以let出来。

1929
01:20:04,056 --> 01:20:07,590
In other words it's not nill, okay?
换句话说就是不为nil，明白吗？

1930
01:20:07,592 --> 01:20:12,161
And if I can let the new image equal new value,
然后如果newValue不为空，

1931
01:20:12,163 --> 01:20:14,563
because this is, we're setting an image here, so
就是我们设置的新图片，

1932
01:20:14,565 --> 01:20:18,800
if I'm able to set an image in this constraint, screen view.
我们就可以为他添加约束了。

1933
01:20:18,802 --> 01:20:20,168
Then I'm gonna create this
这样我只需要让

1934
01:20:20,170 --> 01:20:22,436
aspectRatioConstraint equal to something.
aspectRatioConstraint等于某个值就可以了。

1935
01:20:22,438 --> 01:20:24,605
If I can't set the new image, then I'm gonna
如果image为空，

1936
01:20:24,607 --> 01:20:29,409
set the aspectRatioContraint equal to nil, 'kay.
我会讲aspectRatioConstraint设置为nil，明白吗？

1937
01:20:29,411 --> 01:20:31,644
So someone set my image to nil.
如果别人将图片设置为nil。

1938
01:20:31,646 --> 01:20:32,945
I can't have a constraint.
我就无法添加约束了。

1939
01:20:32,947 --> 01:20:35,647
The aspect ration of nil image is nothing, so I don't,
空图片并没有宽高比，所以不必，

1940
01:20:35,649 --> 01:20:37,849
can't even have a constraint there.
设置约束。

1941
01:20:37,851 --> 01:20:39,684
So how do I create this constraint in the case I
当我们获取到图片的时候

1942
01:20:39,686 --> 01:20:41,419
do have an image for imageView?
怎样创建这个约束呢？

1943
01:20:41,421 --> 01:20:43,220
I just do it with a constructor,
只需要调用构造器即可，

1944
01:20:43,222 --> 01:20:45,556
NSLayoutConstraint, okay?
NSLayoutConstraint（），明白吗？

1945
01:20:45,558 --> 01:20:47,024
Here's what NSLayoutConstraint's
NSLayoutConstraint（）构造器

1946
01:20:47,026 --> 01:20:48,058
constructor looks like.
就是这样子的。

1947
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,592
It's got all these things here,
它需要很多参数，

1948
01:20:49,594 --> 01:20:52,061
let's go through them one at a time, and
我们一个一个来，

1949
01:20:52,063 --> 01:20:54,863
it looks just like that inspector I showed you.
就像inspector一样。

1950
01:20:54,865 --> 01:20:59,067
So one is the thing we're trying to constrain.
首先是你需要添加约束的视图。

1951
01:20:59,069 --> 01:21:03,404
Which is our image view, what attribute of that, it's width,
也就是imageView，被约束的属性是width，

1952
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:08,742
how do we want to relate it to our constants and multipliers?
和constants和multipliers的关系是怎样的呢？

1953
01:21:08,744 --> 01:21:10,343
Well, we're going to do aspect ratio, so
我们想做宽高比约束，所以

1954
01:21:10,345 --> 01:21:12,979
we want the width multiplied times the height.
我们需要width=height*x

1955
01:21:12,981 --> 01:21:17,616
So the width is going to equal the height times the aspect
所以我们让 宽 等于 高 乘以 宽高比

1956
01:21:17,618 --> 01:21:19,551
ratio, so this is going to be equal.
所以我们选择等号。

1957
01:21:20,587 --> 01:21:22,053
And what are we relating it to?
然后相对于哪个视图呢？

1958
01:21:22,055 --> 01:21:24,121
We could relate it to another thing, but
我们可以选择其他视图，但是

1959
01:21:24,123 --> 01:21:27,057
this is the imageviews own aspect ratio, so it's relating
这里是imageView自己的宽高比，所以相对于

1960
01:21:27,059 --> 01:21:31,661
it to itself, okay, and what attribute is it relating to?
它自己，好，那相对于哪个属性呢？

1961
01:21:31,663 --> 01:21:35,365
It's height, and what is the multiplier going to be?
是height，那么乘以哪个数呢？

1962
01:21:35,367 --> 01:21:39,168
It's going to be that new image aspect ratio.
乘以图片的aspectRatio属性。

1963
01:21:40,404 --> 01:21:42,504
Okay? And then this constant gets
明白吗？然后是增加的常量

1964
01:21:42,506 --> 01:21:43,438
added in.
数值。

1965
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,805
We don't want to add anything else in.
我们不需要增加多余的值。

1966
01:21:44,807 --> 01:21:46,073
We just want to multiply.
我们只需要乘以宽高比就可以了。

1967
01:21:46,075 --> 01:21:49,643
So here I'm making this image view's width equal to it's
所以我们让宽等于高乘以

1968
01:21:49,645 --> 01:21:51,411
height times this multiplier.
乘以宽高比即可。

1969
01:21:52,814 --> 01:21:54,030
Make sense?
明白吗？

1970
01:21:54,031 --> 01:21:55,247
That's the constraint I'm putting on it.
这是我天津的约束。

1971
01:21:55,249 --> 01:21:56,281
That's how constraints work.
约束就是这样工作的。

1972
01:21:56,283 --> 01:21:57,366
That's all it is.
就是这些。

1973
01:21:57,367 --> 01:21:58,450
Now a couple of things are not good here.
现在还有一些问题。

1974
01:21:58,452 --> 01:22:02,087
One is there is no such method aspect ratio on UI image.
一个是，UIImage没有aspectRatio方法。

1975
01:22:02,089 --> 01:22:04,622
So I'm gonna go down here and do an extension for that too.
所以我们到下面添加一个extension。

1976
01:22:05,558 --> 01:22:10,727
UIImage var aspectRatio.
添加一个aspectRatio熟悉。

1977
01:22:10,729 --> 01:22:12,195
It's gonna be a CGFloat.
CGFloat类型。

1978
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:16,565
I'm just going to return if my size.height is not zero,
如果不为0就直接返回，

1979
01:22:16,567 --> 01:22:20,069
because I don't wanna have to divide by zero.
因为我不想除数为0.

1980
01:22:20,071 --> 01:22:23,005
Then I'm going to return size.width divided by
然后返回宽除以高，

1981
01:22:23,007 --> 01:22:26,675
size.height, otherwise I guess I'll just return zero.
如果为0救直接返回。

1982
01:22:26,677 --> 01:22:30,378
Okay, so I just added this var to UI image,
好的，为UIImage添加了这个属性，

1983
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:32,463
because I wanted it and
因为我需要它而且

1984
01:22:32,464 --> 01:22:34,547
it makes my code read really nicely right here, okay?
这让代码非常可读又美观，不是吗？

1985
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:36,850
Perfectly reasonable.
非常完美。

1986
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:39,151
And the only other thing is, when I set this aspect ratio
最后一个问题是，当我设置这个宽高比约束时

1987
01:22:39,154 --> 01:22:42,589
constraint I'm creating it, but now I need to enforce it.
我需要将它添加到图片上并使之生效。

1988
01:22:42,591 --> 01:22:45,058
So how do you enforce a constraint?
那么怎样使一个约束生效呢？

1989
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,226
If you have one in your hand, how do you force it?
如果你现在有一个约束，怎样使他生效？

1990
01:22:47,228 --> 01:22:48,594
And it's very simple,
非常简单，

1991
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:51,697
you just add it as a constraint to the view.
你只需要将它添加到视图就可以了。

1992
01:22:51,699 --> 01:22:53,031
So I'm in my view controller here, so
我现在在控制器中，

1993
01:22:53,033 --> 01:22:57,335
I'm going to add this constraint to my view.
我将在这里为视图添加约束。

1994
01:22:57,337 --> 01:23:00,971
So in didSet, any time this aspect ratio gets set up here,
在didSet方法中，每次设置aspetRatio的时候，

1995
01:23:00,973 --> 01:23:02,138
this is where I set it.
我就在这里设置它。

1996
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:03,106
Either to nil or this.
要么为空或不为空。

1997
01:23:04,242 --> 01:23:07,976
Then if I can let this new
如果这个约束

1998
01:23:07,978 --> 01:23:11,813
constraint equal the aspect ratio of constraint.
我可以let出来。

1999
01:23:11,815 --> 01:23:13,581
In other words, if its not nil.
换句话说，如果不为空。

2000
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:16,884
Then I'm gonna tell my view please add this constraint.
我就让视图添加这个约束。

2001
01:23:20,122 --> 01:23:23,490
Now I also, by the way, when it set I want to
同样，随便的，在willSet中

2002
01:23:23,492 --> 01:23:26,793
remove any old constraint cause I might already have
我们需要移除掉

2003
01:23:26,795 --> 01:23:29,328
put a constraint from the previous image I was showing.
已经存在的约束。

2004
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:33,099
So I'm gonna say if let the existing constraint
所以如果aspectRatioConstant

2005
01:23:33,101 --> 01:23:34,867
equal the aspect ratio constraint and
不为空而且

2006
01:23:34,869 --> 01:23:38,636
this is my will set so this hasn't been set yet.
由于这是willSet方法，所以这时aspectRatioConstrain还没有设置

2007
01:23:39,606 --> 01:23:41,538
Then I'm gonna say remove the constraint.
我只需要移除已存在的约束即可。

2008
01:23:44,343 --> 01:23:46,710
Make sense? So that's it.
明白吗？就是这样。

2009
01:23:46,712 --> 01:23:49,278
Okay, and that's all we need to do.
这是我们所有需要做的。

2010
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,180
So let's go ahead and run here.
让我们来测试一下。

2011
01:23:51,182 --> 01:23:53,615
So I'm going to go back to this view here,
更换一下视图模式，

2012
01:23:53,617 --> 01:23:55,884
and select Storyboard here.
选择storyboard。

2013
01:23:55,886 --> 01:23:57,719
All right, so we're going to run this.
开始运行。

2014
01:23:57,721 --> 01:23:59,454
I haven't changed the storyboard since last we
我们至始至终都没有更改过storyboard，

2015
01:23:59,456 --> 01:24:02,756
talked, but now when we go madbomb here.
我们直接运行看看。

2016
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:07,660
This thing, it didn't work.
好像没有成功。

2017
01:24:07,662 --> 01:24:09,696
So why does this not work?
这是为什么呢？

2018
01:24:09,698 --> 01:24:12,465
because, sorry about this, forgot something.
因为，很抱歉，忘了设置些东西。

2019
01:24:12,467 --> 01:24:17,102
When I set my image, I'm not calling my new image property.
当我设置imageView视图的时候，我没有调用这个新image属性。

2020
01:24:17,104 --> 01:24:20,838
I put all that nice code here inside this image
我把实现都写在了image属性的

2021
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:23,174
property, right?
的监听方法中，记得吗？

2022
01:24:23,176 --> 01:24:24,274
Right here.
就是这里。

2023
01:24:24,276 --> 01:24:25,909
But I didn't call it.
但是，我忘了使用它。

2024
01:24:25,911 --> 01:24:28,144
So here I'm actually calling that, so sorry about that.
所以，现在我们改成image，很抱歉。

2025
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:32,314
Why did I [INAUDIBLE] there, imageView.image equals
这里好像写错了，imageView.image应该等于

2026
01:24:32,316 --> 01:24:35,384
newValue, sorry about that, newValue.
newValue，很抱歉。

2027
01:24:35,386 --> 01:24:39,554
Let's go back here, all right.
再运行一次看看。

2028
01:24:39,556 --> 01:24:43,457
See, when I rush, then I make mistakes like that.
你看，当我写的太匆忙，就会出些错误。

2029
01:24:43,459 --> 01:24:44,258
Okay, all right!
好的！

2030
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:44,825
Whoo.
Whoo。

2031
01:24:45,927 --> 01:24:48,361
I think that's the Giants logo down there.
这下面应该就是Giants logo了。

2032
01:24:48,363 --> 01:24:50,329
At least it's the right aspect ratio.
至少宽高比是正确的。

2033
01:24:50,331 --> 01:24:52,498
But clearly, it's terrible to have that thing there
但是很显然，把它放在这里很糟糕

2034
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,533
because it's too tiny and we got all this space.
因为太小了，而上面却有这么大空间空着。

2035
01:24:54,535 --> 01:24:57,035
So last thing we're going to do is
所以，最后一步操作需要

2036
01:24:57,036 --> 01:24:59,536
use the size classes to put this thing up here, okay?
使用size class把logo放到上面来，明白吗？

2037
01:24:59,539 --> 01:25:00,738
How do we do that?
那要怎样做呢？

2038
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:03,774
We go back to our storyboard right here.
我们回到storyboard。

2039
01:25:03,776 --> 01:25:04,875
And right now, we've been doing all our
现在为止，我们都是用的

2040
01:25:04,877 --> 01:25:07,210
work in this any any.
any any来布局。

2041
01:25:07,212 --> 01:25:10,613
Okay, and what we want to do is when we're regular height,
我们只需要，在regular高度的时候，

2042
01:25:10,615 --> 01:25:13,182
we're gonna put the name and the company underneath.
将name和company标签放在底部。

2043
01:25:13,184 --> 01:25:17,419
So I'm gonna go here to where it says any width,
所以我需要到这里改成any 宽度，

2044
01:25:17,421 --> 01:25:18,904
regular height.
regular高度。

2045
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:20,388
You see where it says along the top, any width,
你看到了吗？可以在上面改成any宽度，

2046
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:21,089
regular height.
regular高度。

2047
01:25:21,091 --> 01:25:21,989
See that?
看到了吗？

2048
01:25:21,991 --> 01:25:23,657
I'm gonna click there.
我点击这里。

2049
01:25:23,659 --> 01:25:25,025
Now I'm editing.
开始编辑。

2050
01:25:25,026 --> 01:25:26,392
You see the bar at the bottom is bright blue.
你看底部有一个蓝色的条目。

2051
01:25:26,395 --> 01:25:28,462
That's to remind you,
这是用来提醒你，

2052
01:25:28,463 --> 01:25:30,530
oh hey, you are editing a specific size class here.
嘿，你现在是在一个特定的size class下编辑。

2053
01:25:30,532 --> 01:25:33,299
But we're editing any width, regular height.
因为我们现在在any 宽度和register高度下编辑。

2054
01:25:33,301 --> 01:25:36,469
And so here, this should be in red if I
如果我现在移动他们，

2055
01:25:36,471 --> 01:25:39,838
was doing a slide, this would be in red, which is
约束会变成红色，也就是说

2056
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,607
when you go to another size class, and you're going to be
当你在一个的新size class下编辑的时候，如果你打算

2057
01:25:42,609 --> 01:25:45,510
moving things around, remove the constraints on
移动视图，先去除你要移动的视图上的约束

2058
01:25:45,512 --> 01:25:49,147
the things you're going to be moving before you move them.
再进行移动，

2059
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:50,799
Because once you start moving them,
因为一旦你开始移动视图，

2060
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,450
it's going to be hard to remember, what did that go to.
你就很难记住这些约束了。

2061
01:25:52,452 --> 01:25:54,651
So here I am selecting these all and
所以我选中这几个视图然后

2062
01:25:54,653 --> 01:25:58,488
I am going to go over here and remove the constraint,
到这里移除约束，

2063
01:25:58,490 --> 01:26:00,757
clear the constraints, only from the selected views,
选择清除约束，只清除选中视图的约束，

2064
01:26:00,759 --> 01:26:01,991
these three things I have selected.
也就是我选中的这三个视图。

2065
01:26:01,993 --> 01:26:03,826
So we're going to clear those constraints,
我们会清除他们所有的约束，

2066
01:26:03,828 --> 01:26:05,494
now they have no constraints,
现在他们身上没有约束了，

2067
01:26:05,496 --> 01:26:07,496
now I am just going to move them around to where I want.
我可以随便移动了。

2068
01:26:07,498 --> 01:26:09,130
So I want that one there,
我把这个放这里，

2069
01:26:09,132 --> 01:26:11,399
I want these down here at the bottom.
这个放在底部。

2070
01:26:11,401 --> 01:26:12,366
Put that in the corner.
放在角落。

2071
01:26:12,368 --> 01:26:13,701
I'll put that on top of there.
然后把这个放在上面。

2072
01:26:13,703 --> 01:26:15,769
We'll put this down here like that.
放下一点。

2073
01:26:15,771 --> 01:26:17,604
Now we'll put the new constraints, so
现在我们加新的约束，这样

2074
01:26:17,606 --> 01:26:20,206
now all new constraints that I'm making are only for
所有新加的约束

2075
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:22,008
this size class.
只对当前size class有效。

2076
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,542
Okay? Not for any-any anymore.
明白吗？不再对any-any有效。

2077
01:26:23,544 --> 01:26:25,544
I'm kind of forked off here.
就像叉掉了一样。

2078
01:26:25,546 --> 01:26:27,946
So let's put some new constraints on here.
现在我会加新的约束。

2079
01:26:27,948 --> 01:26:29,547
This one is leaving space.
这个leading space。

2080
01:26:29,549 --> 01:26:31,449
This one is leading space.
这个leading space。

2081
01:26:31,451 --> 01:26:34,018
This one is bottom space.
这个bottom space。

2082
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:35,819
We want these separated.
这两个需要分开。

2083
01:26:35,821 --> 01:26:36,653
Vertical space.
vertical space。

2084
01:26:36,655 --> 01:26:38,888
We want these two separated.
我们需要这两个也分开。

2085
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:41,657
We want this one over here leading space.
这个也添加leading space。

2086
01:26:41,659 --> 01:26:45,160
We want this to go all the way across, and
这一个横向延伸到边缘，然后

2087
01:26:45,162 --> 01:26:47,029
then go trailing space.
加上trailing space。

2088
01:26:47,031 --> 01:26:51,199
You also want this one to go all the way across, and
这样也占满宽度，然后

2089
01:26:51,201 --> 01:26:52,166
trailing space.
trailing space。

2090
01:26:53,269 --> 01:26:54,101
Okay.
好的。

2091
01:26:54,103 --> 01:26:55,769
Again, we would probably go here.
同样，我们需要到这里。

2092
01:26:55,771 --> 01:26:57,403
Let's see what we've got here.
好像有警告。

2093
01:26:57,405 --> 01:26:58,738
Frames are different, that's good.
Frames不同，这很简单。

2094
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:01,039
Let's go ahead and update our frames.
更新frame就可以了。

2095
01:27:02,476 --> 01:27:03,675
Okay, looks good.
好的，看起来不错。

2096
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:05,677
All looks good.
都很好。

2097
01:27:05,678 --> 01:27:07,678
Again, we would probably get rid of these magic numbers
再次强调，我们肯能需要去除所有magic numbers

2098
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:08,245
like this.
像这个。

2099
01:27:08,247 --> 01:27:09,046
We don't like that.
我们不需要它。

2100
01:27:09,048 --> 01:27:09,879
We get rid of that.
去掉。

2101
01:27:09,881 --> 01:27:11,280
We did this one.
这个改了。

2102
01:27:11,282 --> 01:27:12,581
We don't like that.
也不需要这个。

2103
01:27:12,583 --> 01:27:14,917
We go select on this guy.
选择这个视图。

2104
01:27:14,919 --> 01:27:19,287
We've got this here, that.
这个也需要更改。

2105
01:27:19,289 --> 01:27:20,421
Same thing this one.
这个也是。

2106
01:27:20,423 --> 01:27:21,589
Okay, he got none, so we're good.
好的，修改完毕。

2107
01:27:21,591 --> 01:27:22,489
We're good to go.
可以测试了。

2108
01:27:22,491 --> 01:27:25,225
So now we've created this size class.
现在我们创建了这个size class。

2109
01:27:25,227 --> 01:27:28,828
One has different arrangement of views and
它有着不同的布局和

2110
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:29,995
different constraints.
不同的约束。

2111
01:27:29,997 --> 01:27:30,963
So now when we run.
我们运行看看。

2112
01:27:33,133 --> 01:27:33,832
We'll see here.
马上就看到效果了。

2113
01:27:34,868 --> 01:27:35,733
Hit mad bum again.
登陆。

2114
01:27:37,570 --> 01:27:38,602
There it is.
就是这样。

2115
01:27:38,603 --> 01:27:39,635
It's using this space much more
现在更充分地利用了

2116
01:27:39,638 --> 01:27:42,739
effectively keeping this in it's normal aspect ratio, but
垂直方向上的空间，同时保证宽高比正确，并且

2117
01:27:42,741 --> 01:27:44,874
in this way it goes back to the old way.
在横屏模式下以原来的方式布局。

2118
01:27:44,876 --> 01:27:47,843
The any, any way, right?
也就是any any 记得吗？

2119
01:27:47,845 --> 01:27:50,312
Okay, and this is true if we go to someone else.
好的，我们用另一个账户登陆试试。

2120
01:27:50,314 --> 01:27:51,880
Hennessy.
Hennessy。

2121
01:27:51,882 --> 01:27:55,250
There, okay, see how that keeps the same aspect ratio
看，宽高比正常

2122
01:27:55,252 --> 01:27:56,884
and uses that space?
而且充分利用水平空间。

2123
01:27:56,886 --> 01:27:58,953
Really uses the space nicely here, no.
真的充分利用了空间，不。

2124
01:27:58,955 --> 01:28:00,421
>> [LAUGH]
laugh

2125
01:28:00,423 --> 01:28:02,756
>> Now why did that happen, okay?
这是为什么呢？

2126
01:28:02,758 --> 01:28:05,692
Because when I cleared the constraints here,
因为当我清除约束的时候，

2127
01:28:05,694 --> 01:28:10,296
okay, to make this new space, I also cleared this little
增加控件的同时，我也清除了

2128
01:28:10,298 --> 01:28:13,665
constraint that went up here, this vertical spacing.
上面这个约束，垂直距离约束。

2129
01:28:13,667 --> 01:28:15,550
