>> Stanford University.
斯坦福大学

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,875
Welcome to Stanford CS193P, Winter of 2015.
欢迎来到2015年冬季的 CS193P 课程

4
00:00:11,877 --> 00:00:15,979
This is Lecture 9, I believe.
这是第9课

5
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:20,450
And today, we are going to turn on our clicker here and
我先把遥控器打开

6
00:00:20,452 --> 00:00:21,684
then we are going to.
然后我将展示给你们

7
00:00:21,686 --> 00:00:25,454
I'm going to show you a brief, very brief demo,
一个非常简短的 demo

8
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:30,692
in addition to the Autolayout Demo that we did last time.
我们上次写的 Autolayout demo

9
00:00:30,694 --> 00:00:33,361
I challenged you in that one to add buttons to
向 Calculator 中添加一些 button

10
00:00:33,363 --> 00:00:35,429
your calculator, then I didn't show you how to do that.
但是我没有告诉你们该怎么实现

11
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:37,164
So I'm gonna show you how to do that.
所以我会告诉你们怎么做

12
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,732
How, in a different size class,
对于不同的 Size Class

13
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:42,535
you could add some views that aren't in another size class.
你可以添加不一样的 view

14
00:00:42,537 --> 00:00:44,804
Then we're gonna talk about two big topics today.
接下来我们会探讨两个话题

15
00:00:44,806 --> 00:00:46,372
One of them is ScrollView, okay.
一个是 ScrollView （滚动视图）

16
00:00:46,374 --> 00:00:50,009
And the second one is Multithreading.
另一个是 Multithreading（多线程）

17
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:52,144
And, kind of as a preamble to do multithreading,
在讲 Multithreading 之前

18
00:00:52,146 --> 00:00:54,212
I'm going to talk a little bit about closures.
我会提及一些 closure 的知识

19
00:00:54,214 --> 00:00:57,448
Now, you should all have read your reading assignment, so
你们应该都完成了阅读任务

20
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,683
you all know about closures.
所以你们都应该了解一些 closure 的知识

21
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:02,119
But, I just wanna emphasize something about them.
我就是想强调一下这方面的知识

22
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:03,687
That will start to be more important as we
当我们在多线程里使用 closure 的时候

23
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,656
start using closures more for things like multithreading.
这就变得更重要了

24
00:01:06,658 --> 00:01:10,593
So, let's make a quick little detour here.
让我们快速进行以下的内容

25
00:01:10,595 --> 00:01:14,096
I'm just gonna open up Autolayout here.
我先打开 Autolayout 项目

26
00:01:14,098 --> 00:01:15,631
So here's autolayout.
这就是 Autolayout

27
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:18,633
And what I wanna be able to do is add another
我想做的事情是

28
00:01:19,836 --> 00:01:23,704
view only in one of my size classes.
只在其中一个 Size Class 添加一个 view

29
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:25,739
So here's my Any, Any size class.
这是 Any Any Size Class

30
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:29,242
And let's say I go back to my Any Width,
回到之前我们进行到的

31
00:01:29,244 --> 00:01:31,010
Regular Height that we were working on.
Any Width Regular Height Size Class

32
00:01:31,012 --> 00:01:35,180
And let's say, when we're in this particular arrangement,
在这种特殊的布局下

33
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:36,999
we wanna have,
我想要

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,817
you know, an extra button up here or something.
在这里添加一个按钮之类的东西

35
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:41,786
And all we need to do that is to drag out whatever
我们需要做的

36
00:01:41,788 --> 00:01:44,522
the extra UI you want is, like this Button.
就是把你需要的 UI 元素拽进来

37
00:01:44,524 --> 00:01:48,158
And if you inspect the button with the Inspector,
在它们的 Inspector 页面

38
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,393
Attributes Inspector.
Attributes Inspector

39
00:01:49,395 --> 00:01:52,762
Down at the very bottom, you'll see, right here,
在最底下，在这里

40
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:55,898
that there is some switches that control where this
这里有控制这个按钮

41
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,199
button appears.
应该在哪里出现的选项

42
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,968
Now, since I dragged this button into this size class,
我是在当前 Size Class 拖拽进来的

43
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,404
it assumes I only wanted it in this size class.
所以它假定我只想让这个按钮出现在这个 Size Class 里

44
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:05,273
You see where it says Installed, right here?
看到这个 Installed 被选中了吗

45
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:07,508
I could put it in all size classes by clicking this.
我可以通过点击这个地方，把它放入所有的 Size Class 中

46
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,477
That means it'll be in all size classes.
这表示所有的 Size Class

47
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,780
Or I could take it out of this size class only,
或者通过点击它

48
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:15,782
by unclicking this, okay?
我也可以不让它在这个 Size Class 出现

49
00:02:15,784 --> 00:02:18,118
And you can add more things.
你也可以把它添加到更多的 Size Class 中去

50
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,652
I could say in Compact Width,
Compact Width Compact Height

51
00:02:19,654 --> 00:02:22,554
Compact Height, I want this button to be there or not.
我是否希望按钮出现在那里

52
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:25,390
Okay?
OK?

53
00:02:25,392 --> 00:02:28,259
And that's true for constraints, as well.
这对于约束也是适用的

54
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:29,427
If you have a certain constraint.
如果对于某个约束

55
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:31,195
Like we've got constraints down here,
像这里的这个

56
00:02:31,197 --> 00:02:35,298
like this one right here, that are only in this size class.
只在当前 Size Class 里

57
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,134
Because these things are only down here in this size class.
因为它们只出现在当前 Size Class 里

58
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:39,369
So you can see that's switched.
你可以看到，这是可以转换的

59
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:43,739
So, whether something is even there and
不管对于 UI 元素还是约束

60
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:46,208
also the constraints, you can control right here.
你都可以在这里控制

61
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,277
And someone asked me, oh, I did all this work in here, for
有人可能会问

62
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:51,312
all this size class, but I changed my mind.
我在这个 Size Class 做完了所有工作，但是我改变主意了

63
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:53,314
I don't want it to be different in that size class.
我不想在这个 Size Class 不一样

64
00:02:53,316 --> 00:02:55,683
How would I go back and undo all this?
我怎么样才能返回呢？

65
00:02:55,685 --> 00:02:57,468
Well, the way you would do
完成这件事的方法就是

66
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,252
that is bring up your document outline.
打开 Document Outline

67
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:00,820
And you can select all your constraints.
你可以选中所有的约束

68
00:03:00,822 --> 00:03:03,489
You can actually shift > click to select.
也可以按住 shift 进行多选操作

69
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:05,558
I could select all my constraints.
我可以选择所有的约束

70
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,960
And you can see over here, in the Inspector,
你可以在 Inspector 里看到

71
00:03:07,962 --> 00:03:10,195
it's going to show me that, you know, some of.
它会展示给你这些的信息

72
00:03:10,197 --> 00:03:12,731
It's got a dash here instead of a check.
这里是破折号而不是对勾

73
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:14,499
So, kind of some of them are there.
类似的东西

74
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:17,735
And if just go here and say, boom, and remove that.
如果我点击这里移除它

75
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:23,273
Now, all my constraints are only in my base class.
所有的约束现在只存在于 Any Any Size Class 中

76
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:25,041
There's no constraints that are just in this one.
在当前 Size Class 里没有约束了

77
00:03:25,043 --> 00:03:26,909
And, in fact, if you look down here.
如果你看这里

78
00:03:26,911 --> 00:03:29,512
Look, all these constraints are all gone.
所有的约束都消失了

79
00:03:29,514 --> 00:03:31,680
So, in fact, if I go here and Update Frames.
如果我点击 Update Frames

80
00:03:31,682 --> 00:03:33,315
Boom, it goes back to the way it was.
它们就回到了本来的位置

81
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:34,882
You see?
看到了吗

82
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:38,318
Everyone understand that?
每个人都明白了吧？

83
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,755
So, Constraints and the Views can be turned on and off
Constrains 和 View 可以在 Attributes Inspector

84
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:46,059
by just inspecting them in the Attributes Inspector, okay?
被调整显示的 Size Class

85
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:47,593
That's all I wanted to show you there.
这就是我想要展示给你们的

86
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:50,529
All right, back to the slides.
好的，回到 slides

87
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,098
All right, so let's.
好的

88
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:59,369
Talk about ScrollView.
接着我们来讨论 ScrollView

89
00:03:59,371 --> 00:04:02,739
All right so, you can see this iPhone right here.
你可以看到这里有一个 iPhone

90
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:04,858
This is like,
它像 iPhone 1

91
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:06,976
I don't know, iPhone 1 or something-looking thing.
或者其他的版本

92
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:10,079
But, I keep it around because it's a really cool example of
我把它放到这里

93
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:11,380
the power of ScrollView.
是想给你们展现一下 ScrollView 的强大

94
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:12,914
And what you can do with ScrollView.
你可以对 ScrollView 做些什么

95
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,316
Especially with ScrollViews inside ScrollViews.
尤其是 ScrollView 内部还有 ScrollView

96
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:19,286
So, watch this little movie here go as we scroll around,
一起来看看这个短片

97
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:21,555
up and down.
到处滑动

98
00:04:21,556 --> 00:04:23,823
Okay, so that's just normal side-to-side scrolling.
侧面的滑动

99
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:26,660
But there's up and down within the side to side.
在侧面滑动里面还可以上下滑动

100
00:04:26,662 --> 00:04:28,629
When I get to one, I can go up and down.
我可以上下滑动

101
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,597
And then this app, at the bottom, I can scroll side to
对于这个应用，在底部

102
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:33,499
side at the bottom and also up and down.
我可以向两边和上下滑动

103
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:35,234
So, you see how the scrolling can kind of
所以

104
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:36,502
go both directions.
滑动可以向两个方向进行

105
00:04:36,504 --> 00:04:38,470
Depending on what you've scrolled into view.
取决于你要滑动什么

106
00:04:38,472 --> 00:04:43,007
So, ScrollView is very smart about knowing which
ScrollView 很清楚

107
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:44,542
way you're scrolling.
你正向哪个方向滑动

108
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:47,444
And having, you know, opposing ScrollViews and
ScrollView 能够

109
00:04:47,446 --> 00:04:49,780
stuff work properly, okay.
正确地工作

110
00:04:49,782 --> 00:04:52,649
Now, we're not gonna be able to have time, in the brief
我不会占用简短的时间

111
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:55,318
time we have here, to discuss how to make all that work.
讨论怎么让它工作

112
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,019
But I just want you to know the power is there.
我只想让你知道它的能力

113
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:59,521
So, someday, if you wanna build an app that has some UI
如果有一天你做的 App 有这些东西

114
00:04:59,523 --> 00:05:02,190
like that, you know where to go, which is ScrollView.
你应该知道，看 ScrollView 的内容

115
00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:04,392
So, we're gonna talk about the basics of ScrollView.
所以我们来看看 ScrollView 的一些基础

116
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:06,961
Kind of how to get a ScrollView to work.
怎样让 ScrollView 工作

117
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:10,497
First, let's talk about how we add subviews to
首先，怎样在 UIView 中

118
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:11,598
a normal UIView.
添加 SubView

119
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,133
So, I got a normal UIView here.
这里有个普通的 UIView

120
00:05:13,135 --> 00:05:16,703
This white view in my iPhone here.
iPhone 中白色的 view

121
00:05:16,705 --> 00:05:19,305
And I wanna add a subview to it.
我想给它添加 SubView

122
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:22,941
And so, you know, from Lecture 5, I think, that I just create
在 lecture 5 大概，我创建了

123
00:05:22,943 --> 00:05:26,812
the frame which positions it and then I say add subview.
frame 然后 addSubView

124
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:28,413
Okay, so I've got this view called Logo.
把这个 view 起名为 Logo

125
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:30,248
And it's just a UIView.
它是一个 UIView

126
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,850
An image view, probably.
也许是个 imageView

127
00:05:32,852 --> 00:05:35,652
And, so I just add subview and, boom, it appears.
我只是 addSubView，它就出现了

128
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:36,319
Simple as that.
就是这么简单

129
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:37,554
It's really easy.
很简单

130
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:41,457
So, what is the analogy to doing this
ScrollView 类似的处理方法

131
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:42,591
for ScrollView, okay?
是什么？

132
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:45,060
Let's go look at that.
让我们一起看看

133
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:48,463
So, in a ScrollView, if you wanna add a subview.
在 ScrollView 中，如果你想添加 SubView

134
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:51,899
The most important thing you have to do is talk about
需要做的最重要的事情就是

135
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:55,636
how big the area you wanna scroll over is.
你需要滑动的区域有多大

136
00:05:55,638 --> 00:05:59,839
So, you set this property in ScrollView called contentSize.
在 ScrollView 设置叫做 contentSize 的属性

137
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:02,675
So, here I'm gonna set my contentSize to 3000
这里我把它设置为 3000 宽

138
00:06:02,677 --> 00:06:05,378
wide and 2000 high.
2000 高

139
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:08,080
So, I'm gonna scroll over this huge space, okay?
所以我会在这个巨大的区域滑动

140
00:06:08,082 --> 00:06:10,015
Once you set the contentSize,
一旦你设置了 contentSize

141
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:13,751
now you can add subviews just like you do a normal view.
你就可以像一个普通的 view 一样向它添加 SubView 了

142
00:06:13,753 --> 00:06:15,886
So, here I got logo frame.
这里我获取了 logo 的 frame

143
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:20,957
I'm gonna set the frame to way over on the left there and
我把它放到右上角

144
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:23,760
I am going to add its subview.
添加 SubView

145
00:06:23,762 --> 00:06:26,362
So I'm adding that subview to the ScrollView.
向这个 ScrollView 当中

146
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:28,831
But instead of it appearing onscreen there,
为了让它显示在屏幕上

147
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,467
it's just kind of placed in this content area.
你只需要把它放置到 content 区域就可以了

148
00:06:32,503 --> 00:06:33,802
And so, I could add another one.
我也可以添加另外一个

149
00:06:33,804 --> 00:06:37,805
Here's a huge image, aerial view of Stanford.
这是一个 Stanford 的鸟瞰图

150
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:39,873
And so, I'm gonna set its frame and
设置它的 frame

151
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,042
add it as a subview, okay.
给它添加为 SubView

152
00:06:42,044 --> 00:06:43,743
So this is the fundamental,
这是最基本的

153
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:45,011
this is all there is to ScrollView.
ScrollView 的内容

154
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:46,545
It's really simple, actually.
实际上非常简单

155
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:48,080
It confuses people for some reason, but
在某些方面，人们对于这个很困惑

156
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:49,214
it's really just this simple.
不过它就是这么简单

157
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:50,648
You set the contentSize,
设置好 contentSize

158
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,717
then you add subviews to the ScrollView.
给它添加 SubView

159
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:55,786
Now, the ScrollView is just going to
ScrollView 就会在那个 content 区域

160
00:06:55,788 --> 00:06:58,322
be a window on that content area.
变成一个 窗口

161
00:06:58,324 --> 00:07:01,024
You see, it's just gonna scroll around,
你可以到处拖动

162
00:07:01,026 --> 00:07:02,525
looking in that content area.
在 content 区域中

163
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:05,228
And it'll see all the subviews as it
在这个过程中

164
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,363
moves around in there, okay?
可以看到添加的 SubView

165
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:08,664
So, that's it.
就是这样

166
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,900
That's all there is to it.
就这些

167
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:13,135
ScrollView is actually incredibly easy to use.
ScrollView 很容易使用

168
00:07:13,137 --> 00:07:15,637
Now, you can reposition the views, anytime you want,
你可以在任何时候重置 view 的位置

169
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,638
just like you could if they were subviews.
如果有 SubView

170
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,341
You can just change their frame and they'll move around.
你可以改变它们的 frame，它们就会到处移动

171
00:07:20,343 --> 00:07:22,976
Or change the logo's frame, move it around.
改变 logo 的 frame，移动它

172
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:24,678
I can also change the contentSize.
我也可以改变 contentSize

173
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,147
[NOISE] And now it zooms down.
现在它向下移动

174
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:28,781
I can set the contentSize to be
我可以把 contentSize 设置为

175
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:30,683
the size of the biggest subview.
最大 SubView 的尺寸

176
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:32,585
And now, again,
同样地

177
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,486
when I scroll around, it's just zooming around, okay.
当我滑动的时候它也在移动

178
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,088
So it's very common in the ScrollView,
这在 ScrollView 中很常见

179
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,724
obviously, to set its contentSize to be the size of
把 contentSize 设置为

180
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,726
the biggest subview.
最大 SubView 的尺寸

181
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,327
So that it exactly contains it.
刚好能容纳下它

182
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,331
Okay, now, as this thing moves around, you might wanna know,
当它到处移动的时候

183
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,965
where is it, okay?
你想知道现在的位置

184
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:54,836
What we are currently looking at in my content area?
我们在看 content 区域的什么东西

185
00:07:54,838 --> 00:07:56,971
And you do that with the property in
你可以通过 ScrollView 的

186
00:07:56,973 --> 00:07:59,273
ScrollView called contentOffset.
叫 contenteOffset 的属性获取

187
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:00,892
And it's simple.
很简单

188
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:02,510
It's just an x-y offset from the upper left,.
它是一个对于左上角顶点的 x-y 偏移

189
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:04,278
Of the upper left of the,
ScrollView bounds

190
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,947
you know, bounds of the scroll view.
的左上角

191
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:10,516
Okay, now what about the actual rectangle
正在显示的

192
00:08:10,518 --> 00:08:12,284
that's showing?
真正的矩形区域

193
00:08:12,286 --> 00:08:14,270
What is that?
是什么

194
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:16,255
That is actually the scroll view's bounds.
它实际上 ScrollView 的 bounds

195
00:08:16,257 --> 00:08:18,323
Okay, it's very important to understand that that is
理解这一点很重要

196
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:20,859
just the scroll view bound, that yellow rectangle I'm
我正在给你展示的黄色矩形

197
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:23,761
showing you there, that's the scroll view's bounds.
是 ScrollView 的 bound

198
00:08:23,763 --> 00:08:26,030
But if you want to know what that rectangle is
如果你想知道在 content 中

199
00:08:26,032 --> 00:08:29,566
in the content, like, in that aerial view,
这个矩形的坐标，在 aerial view 中

200
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:31,601
what is that rectangle, then you have to convert it.
你可以转换坐标

201
00:08:31,603 --> 00:08:34,237
You have to convert the scrollView's bounds using
使用 convertRect 方法

202
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:37,774
convertRect, [COUGH] which is UIView method.
是个 UIView 的方法

203
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:39,775
You have to convert it to that,
你可以把它转换为

204
00:08:39,777 --> 00:08:42,978
to whatever view you wanna convert it
你想要转换的任何 View 的坐标

205
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,480
to like the aerial view whatever that aerial view is.
无论是哪个 aerial view

206
00:08:45,482 --> 00:08:47,549
Does that make sense?
能听懂吗？

207
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:49,650
So that rectangle is the scroll view's bounds.
这个矩形是 ScrollView 的 bounds

208
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:51,618
Okay?
OK?

209
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:53,619
Questions?
有问题吗？

210
00:08:54,789 --> 00:08:56,255
All right. That's easy.
这很简单

211
00:08:56,257 --> 00:08:57,673
So that's it.
就是这样

212
00:08:57,674 --> 00:08:59,090
That's pretty much it to setting up a scroll view and
这基本上就是

213
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:00,759
knowing where the thing is scrolling.
设置 ScrollView 的一些步骤

214
00:09:00,761 --> 00:09:02,460
Couldn't be simpler actually.
不能再简单了

215
00:09:02,462 --> 00:09:04,161
How do you create a scroll view?
如何创建一个 ScrollView

216
00:09:04,163 --> 00:09:05,996
There's actually numerous ways to do it.
实际上有好几种方法可以实现

217
00:09:05,998 --> 00:09:07,764
You can drag one into your storyboard.
你可以拽一个到 StoryBoard 中

218
00:09:07,766 --> 00:09:09,750
That's what I'm gonna do in the demo.
我在 demo 中也会这么做

219
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:11,735
You can actually select a UI view in your storyboard and
你也可以在 storyboard 中选中一个 UIView

220
00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:14,303
go up to the menu up there,
在餐单中

221
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:17,139
and say embed in scroll view, just like we did embed in
embed in scroll view 

222
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:19,308
navigation controller in a previous thing.
就像我们在之前 Embed in Navigation Controller 一样

223
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,510
You can of course create Scroll Views in code.
你可以使用代码创建 ScrollView

224
00:09:21,512 --> 00:09:22,644
They're just views, so
它是 view

225
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,746
you can write a UIScrollView frame whatever.
你可以创建一个 UIScrollView frame 之类的

226
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:26,047
And boom, you've created a Scroll View.
这样你就创建了一个 ScrollView

227
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:28,816
So, they're just normal views.
它们只是普通的 view

228
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,684
And then the code if you wanted to
如果你想通过代码添加

229
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:33,720
add those subviews in code would look exactly kind of
SubView，那么这些代码

230
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:35,922
like what was on the previous slides.
和之前 slides 的会看起来完全一样

231
00:09:35,924 --> 00:09:38,190
Which is we might create an image view here,
也许创建了一个 imageView

232
00:09:38,192 --> 00:09:40,959
the green is just creating UI image view,
绿色的部分创建了一个 UIImageView

233
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:43,462
and then I'm just calling addSubview.
然后我调用了 addSubView

234
00:09:43,464 --> 00:09:45,630
But if you just do this, these three lines of code,
如果你只写这三行代码，它不会有效

235
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:48,199
it won't work because you have to set the content size.
因为你还没有设置好 contentSize

236
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:49,934
If you don't set the content size,
如果你没有设置 contenSize

237
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:52,403
it starts out zero, until you bring your Scroll View up,
它以0开始

238
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:53,837
and they'll be nothing there.
它上面就会什么都没有

239
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,773
Because you won't have that big white area to scroll
因为你不会有那个

240
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:57,440
around in.
巨大的白色区域来滑动

241
00:09:57,442 --> 00:09:58,507
Okay?
ok

242
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:00,075
So no matter what Sub Views you add,
不管你添加了什么 SubView

243
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:02,177
if you don't have that big white area defined,
如果你没有设置 contentSize

244
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:04,279
then Scroll View will not be showing anything.
ScrollView 就不会显示任何东西

245
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:05,646
Okay, so it's as simple as that.
就是这么简单

246
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:08,983
This is a review of what I showed you graphically.
这是对之前的总结

247
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:10,217
Now you can scroll around.
现在你可以到处滑动

248
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:12,486
The user scrolls around by just using their finger.
用户通过手指滑动

249
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:13,920
Right? They pan around.
使用 pan 手势

250
00:10:13,922 --> 00:10:16,723
But you can scroll programmatically too by saying
你也可以通过代码滑动

251
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:20,026
scrollRectToVisible and this will take a rectangle in the
调用 scrollRectToVisible 

252
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:23,462
content areas view coordinate system, that content size.
content 区域的坐标系统

253
00:10:23,464 --> 00:10:27,666
And it'll scroll the Scroll View to be showing that.
然后使得 ScrollView 滑动到那里展示这个内容

254
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,034
And animated is whether it slides over.
animated 参数是是否滑动过去

255
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:32,136
If you don't say animated, it's just gonna jump there.
如果为 false，它会直接跳到那里

256
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:34,538
Which is kind of abrupt to the user, if it's on screen.
这会有些唐突

257
00:10:35,874 --> 00:10:37,441
And there's tons of other things you can do
你也可以做好多别的事情

258
00:10:37,442 --> 00:10:39,009
with a Scroll View that I'm not gonna really talk about.
我不会讲太多

259
00:10:39,011 --> 00:10:41,444
But you can lock the scrolling direction, so
你可以锁定滑动的区域

260
00:10:41,446 --> 00:10:44,847
it'll only scroll up and down, or only scroll left and right.
它只能向左右滑动或上下滑动

261
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:48,316
It'll flash the scroll indicators if the content size
如果 contentSize 修改了，scroll indicators 会闪一下

262
00:10:48,318 --> 00:10:49,217
has changed.
如果它改变了

263
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:50,918
You can control that.
你可以控制它

264
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,054
There's a whole bunch of stuff you can look at
你可以在文档中

265
00:10:53,056 --> 00:10:54,722
UIScrollView in the documentation.
看到大量的关于 ScrollView 的东西

266
00:10:54,724 --> 00:10:55,822
Okay?
Ok?

267
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:59,726
I'm going to have one thing important about
我会介绍 ScrollView 中

268
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:01,727
scrollview which is zooming.
很重要的一个东西，就是 zooming

269
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:03,713
Cuz so
到目前为止

270
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:05,698
far I just showed you kind of moving around and of course in
我给你们展示了怎样到处滑动

271
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,468
scroll you can also zoom in on the content area, okay?
当然 ScrollView 也可以 zoom in

272
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:15,906
Zooming in requires you to do a few things though.
zoom in 需要你做一些工作

273
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,975
One thing is you have to set the minimum and
其中一件事是

274
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,943
maximum zoom scale.
设置 zoom scale 的最大值和最小值

275
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:23,146
So the zoom scale is just how much you'll zoom in.
zoom scale 是你 zoom in 的程度

276
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:25,748
So, if you have a zoom scale of 2.0,
如果设置为2.0

277
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,785
then that means that you'll only zoom to twice the scale.
这表明你只能 zoom 为原来的两倍大小

278
00:11:29,787 --> 00:11:33,022
And if you're 2.5, it'll zoom down to half of whatever
2.5 表示 2.5 倍

279
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:34,923
the normal size is of the thing you're looking at is.
normal size 是你正在观察的尺寸

280
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:36,091
So you have to set these.
所以你需要设置这些

281
00:11:36,093 --> 00:11:39,060
If you don't set these they'll be default to 1, and
如果你没有设置这些，那默认是1

282
00:11:39,062 --> 00:11:42,196
it won't work because the scaling will go from 1 to 1.
因为 scale 只能从1到1，所以不会起作用

283
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:43,581
Okay? And so
OK?

284
00:11:43,582 --> 00:11:44,965
that means not scaling at all.
这表示根本不 scale

285
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:46,800
The other thing you have to do is use a delegate.
另一件需要做的事时使用 delegate

286
00:11:46,802 --> 00:11:48,735
So here's the second time I've showed you a delegate.
这是我第二次给你们展示使用 delegate

287
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:50,770
Now I had you do all that work with a calculator to
在 calculator 中

288
00:11:50,772 --> 00:11:52,371
do the delegate so that you'd be
我使用了 delegate

289
00:11:52,373 --> 00:11:54,907
ready to do things in iOS that use delegates.
第一次使用 delegate

290
00:11:54,909 --> 00:11:55,674
And here's one.
这是第二次

291
00:11:55,676 --> 00:11:57,475
'Kay. You've set yourself as
你把自己设置为 ScrollView 的 delegate

292
00:11:57,477 --> 00:12:00,111
the ScrollView's delegate, and you implement this method.
然后你实现它的方法

293
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:01,412
You have to implement this method if
你需要实现这个方法

294
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:04,648
you want zooming called viewForZoomingInScrollView.
viewForZoomingInScrollView

295
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:09,119
So the scroll view when it's zooming, it only zooms in,
当 ScrollView 在 zooming 的时候，它只 zoom in

296
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:11,954
in the coordinate systems of one of its views.
在它 view 中得坐标系统中

297
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:14,156
So usually it's kind of the background view.
通常来说它是背景的 view

298
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:15,391
Like in that aerial example,
就像 aerial 的例子

299
00:12:15,393 --> 00:12:18,160
it would be the aerial view that we would zoom in, okay.
我们 zoom in 的是 aerial view

300
00:12:18,162 --> 00:12:20,095
But we're zooming the whole contents, so
但是我们 zoom 的是整个 content
301
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:21,346
everything gets zoomed,
全部都会缩放，

302
00:12:21,347 --> 00:12:22,596
but that's gonna be the view that you're zooming in.
但是你需要在一个视图里进行缩放。

303
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:24,932
So you have to tell it which view that is.
你需要告诉系统这是哪个视图。

304
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:26,066
It's usually pretty obvious.
通常来说这是显而易见的。

305
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:28,085
Often times in ScrollView,
通常来说

306
00:12:28,086 --> 00:12:30,103
you're only scrolling on one view anyway but
你只会在一个视图上滚动，但是

307
00:12:30,105 --> 00:12:32,405
you still have to implement this, okay.
你依然需要实现这个方法。

308
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,775
You can zoom programatically once you've set those two
正确的完成这两步后，你就可以使用代码

309
00:12:35,777 --> 00:12:37,076
things up properly.
来进行缩放了。

310
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:40,112
Then you can set the zoom scale, how zoomed in you are.
你可以设置缩放比例。

311
00:12:40,114 --> 00:12:41,713
It looks kind of like this.
就像这样，

312
00:12:41,715 --> 00:12:43,114
So, here I've got a picture.
这里有一张图片。

313
00:12:43,116 --> 00:12:45,483
Let's say my zoomScale is 1.2.
我的缩放比例是1.2.

314
00:12:45,485 --> 00:12:46,784
I go to zoomScale 1.
现在改成1

315
00:12:46,786 --> 00:12:50,987
I zoom out, zoom back to 1.2 zoomed in.
然后再放大，现在是1.2.

316
00:12:50,989 --> 00:12:53,089
Okay? And same thing with zoom rect.
缩放矩形也是一样的。

317
00:12:53,091 --> 00:12:55,658
So if I had a little rectangle like that yellow area and
如果我有一个黄色区域这样的小矩形。

318
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,861
I said zoom to that rect, it would zoom to make that
然后我要缩放到这个矩形，图片就会缩放

319
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:01,630
rect fill the edges as much as it could.
到尽可能适应这个矩形。

320
00:13:01,632 --> 00:13:03,798
Or if I have a rect that was really big, and
或者我有一个很大的矩形，

321
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,335
I said zoom it would zoom it down to fit.
图片就会缩小去适应它。

322
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:08,702
Okay?

323
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:13,440
So, zoomToRect means make this rect kind of either go big or
所以zoomToRect方法就是提供一个矩形，然后背景放大或

324
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:14,774
go small to fit.
缩小去适应它。

325
00:13:14,776 --> 00:13:16,776
Okay?

326
00:13:16,778 --> 00:13:18,143
All right?
好的。

327
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:19,978
There are tons of other delegate methods in
滚动视图有非常多的代理

328
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,730
scroll view.
方法。

329
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:23,481
One thing, when you start using scroll view,
这里有一个问题，当你开始使用滚动视图的时候，

330
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:25,183
you're going to ask me is,
你可能会问我，

331
00:13:25,185 --> 00:13:28,085
hey, scroll view has 12 delegate methods.
滚动视图有12个代理方法。

332
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:30,854
And when I say I implement the UIScrollView delegate
当我要实现滚动视图的代理协议时

333
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:33,790
protocol, how come the compiler doesn't complain and
为什么编译器没有抱怨说我必须实现

334
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:36,659
say that it will implement those 12 methods because I
这12个代理方法？我认为如果我说要实现

335
00:13:36,661 --> 00:13:38,995
thought if I said I implemented a protocol,
一个协议，我就要实现协议规定的

336
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:41,630
I have to implement all those protocols, okay?
所有方法。

337
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,633
The reason that that happens, that you don't get
编译器没有警告的原因是

338
00:13:45,635 --> 00:13:48,636
a warning there is because there is actually, for
因为一些历史原因，

339
00:13:48,638 --> 00:13:51,605
historical reasons, a different kind of protocol,
还有一种其他类型的协议，

340
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:54,641
which is an Objective-C style protocol.
也就是 Objective-C 的协议。

341
00:13:54,643 --> 00:13:56,276
Objective C was the old language that iOS
Objective-C 是一种老语言，iOS就是用它写成的。

342
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:59,279
was written in and in the Objective C style protocols
在 Objective-C 的协议里，

343
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:02,248
some methods in the protocol were allowed to be optional.
一些方法可以是可选的。

344
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,716
Now that's not true in Swift,
Swift不可以这样，

345
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,819
but that's true in Objective C.
但是 Objective-C 可以。

346
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:11,156
So all these old delegate protocols like
所以像滚动视图代理协议这种老的

347
00:14:11,158 --> 00:14:13,658
scroll view that have optional methods in them,
协议，里边都是有可选方法的。

348
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,160
Swift knows how to bridge them.
Swift 知道如何桥接他们。

349
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:19,363
You can actually create your own Objective C compatible
事实上你也可以自己写一个 有可选方法的 Objective-C 风格的

350
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:22,799
protocol with optional methods by saying @objc in front of
协议，只需要在协议声明之前加上

351
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:24,534
your protocol declaration.
@objc 。

352
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:27,403
So where you would say protocol face view delegate or
比如你可以写一个 FaceViewDelegate 或者

353
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:29,271
face view data source you would say
FaceViewDataSource，在声明的时候

354
00:14:29,273 --> 00:14:32,007
@objc space protocol, whatever delegate, and
写@objc 空格 protocol, 

355
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:34,109
then you could put optional in there.
然后你就可以定义可选方法了。

356
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:35,744
And you can read,
你可以在

357
00:14:35,745 --> 00:14:37,378
this is all covered in the reading assignments, so
阅读材料里读到这些内容，希望

358
00:14:37,381 --> 00:14:39,547
hopefully you've got that.
你们已经都看过了。

359
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,116
But that's the magic that makes it so that when you say
正是因为有这个魔法，所以在你

360
00:14:42,118 --> 00:14:44,918
you implement the UIScrollView delegate protocol and
需要实现滚动视图代理协议的时候，你不需要

361
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,088
you don't yet implement all the 12 methods in there.
实现它里边全部的12个方法。

362
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,656
In fact you only need to implement the ones you
你只需要实现你想实现的方法，

363
00:14:49,658 --> 00:14:53,325
want like view for zooming and scroll view.
比如缩放什么的。

364
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:54,793
That's why that works.
这就是为什么不会报错。

365
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:55,994
So anyway there are a bunch of
当然还有很多

366
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,395
other delegate methods in there.
别的代理方法。

367
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,665
For example scrollViewDidEndZooming.
比如 scrollViewDidEndZooming 。

368
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:03,467
So that will be sent to you when the user pinches and
这个方法会在用户用手指缩放完毕离开屏幕的时候

369
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,302
then they lift their finger up.
被调用。

370
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,603
'Kay? And it'll say oh,
它会知道

371
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,371
the user has finished zooming and
用户现在已经结束缩放，而且也能知道

372
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:10,673
this is the scale they left it at.
现在的缩放比例。

373
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:13,142
And you, at that point, might want to redraw your view to
在这个时间点，你可能需要重绘你的视图让它看上去

374
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:16,511
be less grainy, or something like that.
不那么模糊，或者类似的事儿。

375
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:18,747
If you do redraw your view at the new scale,
如果你确实要在新的缩放比例重绘视图，

376
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:21,616
you want to make sure you reset the transform.
那么你需要确保你重置了 transform 。

377
00:15:21,618 --> 00:15:22,850
Okay. This property on
这是一个视图的属性，

378
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:25,953
view called transform is an Affine transform.
它是一种仿射变换。

379
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:28,789
Really that's all scroll view is modifying.
当你在滚动视图上滑动手指或者

380
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:29,989
When you pan around and
所缩放操作的时候，

381
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:32,759
zoom in, it's just modifying the property transform.
实际上就是在改动这个属性。

382
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:35,261
So, you can go look at the documentation for transform in
你们可以去看视图里 transform的文档去

383
00:15:35,263 --> 00:15:37,196
view to understand what's going on there.
深入了解一下。

384
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:40,699
Yeah, it makes scroll view really easy in that it
这使得滚动视图的操作很好理解，因为都是

385
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:42,233
just is modifying this transform.
在改变这个属性。

386
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,235
All right, so that's scroll view.
好，这就是滚动视图。

387
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:45,636
So, I have a demo of scroll view.
下边有一个滚动视图的演示。

388
00:15:45,638 --> 00:15:46,937
We're going to learn some other
在做这个演示的时候，我们还会学

389
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:49,039
things along the way while we're doing that.
一些其他的东西。

390
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:52,408
Okay, let's do that.
开始

391
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,476
Let's go over here.
这里

392
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:54,977
We're gonna start from scratch again.
我们从头开始做。

393
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:57,446
So I'm gonna create a new Xcode project.
建一个新的Xcode项目。

394
00:15:57,448 --> 00:15:58,914
'Kay. It's gonna be Single View.
单视图应用。

395
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:00,381
Those of you who like to follow along are not gonna be
想跟着做的人今天可能

396
00:16:00,384 --> 00:16:01,015
able to today.
不行了。

397
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:02,183
Sorry.
不好意思。

398
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:05,452
Because I'm going to be dragging in a file with some
因为我要直接拖一个有很多URL的文件

399
00:16:05,454 --> 00:16:07,855
URLs in it.
进来。

400
00:16:07,856 --> 00:16:10,257
I'm going to call this thing Cassini.
给项目起名叫cassini。

401
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:12,826
That's going to be the name of my app.
这个就是我的应用的名字。

402
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:14,794
And I'm gonna put it where I always put everything.
还放在原来的地方。

403
00:16:15,763 --> 00:16:18,831
All right, I'm not going to be doing anything with the app
跟原来一样，我们不需要改动AppDelegate这个

404
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:19,898
delegate as usual.
文件。

405
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,599
I'm not going to be doing image assets.
这次也不改动图片库。

406
00:16:21,601 --> 00:16:24,035
I'm not going to do the launch screen.
不改动启动屏幕。

407
00:16:24,037 --> 00:16:27,138
So, here I just have a simple storyboard.
只需要这个简单的 storyboard。

408
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,472
I'm gonna also get rid of
这些关于视图控制器

409
00:16:28,474 --> 00:16:30,574
all this ViewController life cycle here.
生命周期的方法也没用。

410
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:31,174
I don't need that.
这次不需要。

411
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,809
Get rid of that.
删掉。

412
00:16:33,811 --> 00:16:37,112
And so here, simple storyboard only has this one
现在这个简单的storyboard只有一个叫

413
00:16:37,114 --> 00:16:40,382
view controller here called ViewController.
ViewController的视图控制器。

414
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:41,683
And I'm not even gonna pay any attention to
而且我也不需要关注这个

415
00:16:41,685 --> 00:16:43,168
this view controller.
视图控制器。

416
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,652
Actually, I'm gonna create a new view controller.
我要建一个新的视图控制器。

417
00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:47,722
I'm gonna drag it out here and this new view controller,
从这拖一个出来，这个新的视图控制器

418
00:16:47,724 --> 00:16:51,958
its only job in life it's going to display an image.
唯一的任务就是显示一个图片。

419
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,662
So I'm going give it the URL of an image, a JPEG file or
我可能会传递给它一个图片的URL，JPEG文件或者别的

420
00:16:56,664 --> 00:16:59,765
whatever, and it's going to display it.
什么东西，反正就是显示图片。

421
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,734
That's going to be its job in life.
这就是它全部的工作。

422
00:17:01,736 --> 00:17:03,669
So I need a new view controller for that.
我需要一个新的视图控制器文件。

423
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:06,504
So I'm going to call this new view controller.
我要给它起名叫。。。。

424
00:17:06,506 --> 00:17:07,822
All right? I'm going here,
点这，

425
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:09,139
Cocoa Touch Class, it's a view controller.
Cocoa Touch 类，视图控制器。

426
00:17:09,142 --> 00:17:11,842
I'm gonna call it ImageViewController.
起名叫 ImageViewController 。

427
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:14,278
Cuz that's what it does, it displays an image.
因为这就是它要干的活，显示一张图片。

428
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,180
Okay? Very, very simple.
非常简单。

429
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:18,081
I'm gonna put it where all the rest of my stuff goes, there.
把它跟我其他的东西放到一起，这。

430
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:20,183
All right? So here we go again.
好了，又要来一次，

431
00:17:20,185 --> 00:17:21,484
Again, I'm gonna get rid of my
把所有的视图控制器生命周期

432
00:17:21,486 --> 00:17:22,985
view controller life cycle there.
相关的方法删掉。

433
00:17:22,987 --> 00:17:25,787
We're gonna actually add some of those back,
实际上一会儿可能会加一些方法回来，

434
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:28,857
cuz part of the reason I'm doing this demo, also,
这也是我们做这个演示的一部分，

435
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:30,925
is to show you a little bit where and
会给你们演示一些视图控制器生命

436
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:34,128
why, how we would use a view controller life cycle.
周期的内容。

437
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,097
So, my ImageViewController, one other thing,
还有一个事，

438
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:40,667
let me make sure in our storyboard here, we got this thing,
我得确认一下在storyboard里，

439
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:43,436
I'm gonna make sure I change the identity of it
我要把这个视图控制器的类改成

440
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,371
to be an ImageViewController.
ImageViewController

441
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:47,506
So this is an ImageViewController.
现在是 ImageViewController 了。

442
00:17:47,508 --> 00:17:51,710
This is an easy thing to forget, but do that.
这个事情非常容易忘。

443
00:17:51,712 --> 00:17:54,479
Okay, so what do I need in my ImageViewController.
在我的 ImageViewController 里，

444
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:57,048
Well, I need a UIImageView.
我需要一个 UIImageView 。

445
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,550
We saw that in the Auto Layout demo.
我们在自动布局的演示里见过了。

446
00:17:59,552 --> 00:18:02,286
It's a just a view, kind of like a UI label for images.
它就是一种视图，一种显示图片的标签。

447
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:03,787
Obviously if I'm going to have ImageViewController,
显然如果我要做一个显示图片的视图控制器，

448
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:05,656
I'm going to need one of those.
我肯定需要一个这个东西。

449
00:18:05,657 --> 00:18:07,524
Now, I could just drag it out into my story board, but
我可以从storyboard里拖一个进去，但是

450
00:18:07,526 --> 00:18:10,560
I want to use this demo as an example to show you
我希望通过这个演示给你们看一下如何通过代码

451
00:18:10,562 --> 00:18:14,096
how you create a view in code, create and use a view in code.
来新建一个视图并使用它。

452
00:18:14,098 --> 00:18:17,700
So instead, I'm just gonna have a private var here.
这里我建一个私有变量。

453
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:19,534
I'm gonna call it imageView.
我叫它 imageView 。

454
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:21,736
And it's going to be a UIImageView.
类型是 UIImageView。

455
00:18:21,738 --> 00:18:24,105
In fact, I'm just gonna create it right here.
我要在这直接新建。

456
00:18:24,107 --> 00:18:25,089
Okay.

457
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,072
So I have this image view.
现在我又了这个图片视图。

458
00:18:26,075 --> 00:18:27,574
I'm just calling it there.
我在这直接新建了。

459
00:18:27,576 --> 00:18:29,242
Notice, I'm not using the frame.
注意我没用frame新建。

460
00:18:29,244 --> 00:18:30,443
So it's going to create this image view.
所以我这个新的图片视图

461
00:18:30,445 --> 00:18:32,812
It's going to be zero, zero, by zero, zero.
的frame就是

462
00:18:32,814 --> 00:18:34,380
It's going to be, it's framed.
（0,0,0,0)

463
00:18:34,382 --> 00:18:37,383
It's going to be, now it's not in any super view anyways, so
现在它不属于任何视图，

464
00:18:37,385 --> 00:18:39,184
it really doesn't matter what its frame is yet.
所以它的frame 是啥也不重要。

465
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:40,418
Okay. It's obviously going to
当然，在我们让它显示

466
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,920
matter a lot once we start putting images in there.
图片的时候就很重要了。

467
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:46,157
I'm also going to create a little private var
这里我还要写一个叫 image 的

468
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:48,058
here called image.
私有变量。

469
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,127
And this is going to be a computed var.
这是一个计算属性。

470
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,695
I did this in Auto Layout as well.
在自动布局演示里我做过。

471
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,063
It's going to be a UIImage.
它是UIImage类型的。

472
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:57,099
And all I'm going to to here in the getter,
在 getter 方法里，

473
00:18:57,101 --> 00:19:00,536
I'm just going to return the imageView's image.
我让它返回 imageView.image 。

474
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:02,438
And in the setter,
在 setter 方法里，

475
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,339
I'm basically just going to set the imageView's image to
我直接就写 imageView.image = newValue.

476
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:05,507
the new value.

477
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:07,041
Now, why do I do this?
为什么要这么做？

478
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:09,310
'Kay, I'm doing this for
我这么做的原因

479
00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:11,578
the exact same reason that I was doing it in the other one,
跟我之前做的完全一样，

480
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:14,848
which is that when the image is set in my imageView,
我希望我的 imageView 的图片设定好以后，

481
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,117
I want to be able to do things, I want to intervene.
我可以对它做事，我可以干预它。 

482
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,719
So I basically I want to kind of be able to do
所以我想要做一些

483
00:19:19,721 --> 00:19:22,955
the did set kind of thing to make that work.
类似于didSet的事情。

484
00:19:24,692 --> 00:19:28,126
So, what's my warning here, UIImage.
啊，这个警告是什么，UIImage 。

485
00:19:28,128 --> 00:19:31,830
Okay, so here we go.
好了。

486
00:19:31,832 --> 00:19:34,766
So in other words right here, when this is set,
换句话说，当这个设置的时候，

487
00:19:34,768 --> 00:19:36,167
when this image gets set.
当这个图片设置的时候。

488
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:38,769
Setting this image just is going to set the image in
设置这个图片就是设置了imageView的图片，

489
00:19:38,771 --> 00:19:40,570
the imageView, that's all it does.
这是这句代码的意思。

490
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:42,072
But I can put other code that I
下边我还想加更多的

491
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:43,539
want down here because I'm going to
代码，因为我希望在我的图片变更的时候

492
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,975
need to do some things every time my image changes.
可以做更多的事情。

493
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,577
I don't care about getting but every time my
我不关心 getter，但是每次图片设置了

494
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:51,880
image gets set in my imageView I need to do some stuff.
的时候我希望imageView可以做一些事情。

495
00:19:51,882 --> 00:19:52,447
Let me see.
那么

496
00:19:52,449 --> 00:19:55,249
Well, let's talk about what some of those things might be.
让我们看看可以做什么。

497
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:57,301
For example,
比如，

498
00:19:57,302 --> 00:19:59,352
when I set it I probably want to do imageView.sizeToFit.
当我设置图片的时候，我希望做 imageView.sizeToFit 。

499
00:20:00,823 --> 00:20:02,622
Okay. So when you change the image
当我们改变图片视图里的图片时，

500
00:20:02,624 --> 00:20:05,625
that's in image view, this is kind of like saying label.text
这个就好像是 label.text 等于什么什么。

501
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:08,661
equals something, right, I'm changing the imageView that,
事实上我是在修改图片视图，

502
00:20:08,663 --> 00:20:10,729
the image that the imageView's showing.
修改它的显示的图片。

503
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:13,699
When you change it, it does not change the bounds or
但是当我们改这个的时候，不会改变图片视图的bounds

504
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:15,400
the frames of the image view.
或者frame。

505
00:20:15,402 --> 00:20:18,069
So, sizeToFit causes it to.
sizeToFit 可以。

506
00:20:18,071 --> 00:20:21,872
So ImageView looks at the image, sees how big it is and
图片视图会观察图片，看它有多大，然后根据这个来拓展自己的

507
00:20:21,874 --> 00:20:23,707
expands its frame to fit.
frame去适应它。


508
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:26,676
So that's clearly something I'm going to do every time I
这个很显然在我每次变更图片的时候希望

509
00:20:26,678 --> 00:20:28,044
change the image I want to do that.
做到的。

510
00:20:28,046 --> 00:20:31,013
So now you can see why I have this nice little convenience.
所以现在你知道我为啥要这么做了。

511
00:20:31,015 --> 00:20:32,915
You can kind of think this is similar to
你可以把它想成setImage

512
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:35,450
having a function called setImage.
方法。

513
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:37,619
But it's just nicer to do it as a property cuz then I
但是把它当作属性这样处理更好，我同时有了 getter 和 setter，

514
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:41,089
get set and get and my code looks really nice.
而且代码更漂亮。

515
00:20:41,091 --> 00:20:43,691
'Kay, so there's that.
这个完事了。

516
00:20:43,693 --> 00:20:47,828
I'm also going to do viewDidLoad, okay?
下边我要实现一下 viewDidLoad 。

517
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,597
So viewDidLoad, we know that we of course need to call
首先，我们当然需要调用super,

518
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:53,099
super, and what I'm gonna do in viewDidLoad?
我要在 viewDidLoad 里做什么呢？

519
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:56,135
Well, I'm just gonna add my imageView to
我需要把图片视图加入到

520
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:58,637
the view hierarchy.
视图的继承树里。

521
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:00,506
Okay, I'm going to plop it right here.
我要把它放在这。

522
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:02,507
Again my storyboard, got this thing,
在我的storyboard里，要把这个视图

523
00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:04,042
got my view as a top level view.
作为顶级视图。

524
00:21:04,044 --> 00:21:05,743
I'm just going to add my view in here.
我现在要把图片视图加进来。

525
00:21:05,745 --> 00:21:07,878
Now, I'm not doing a scroll view yet, okay.
到目前，我还没开始做滚动视图。

526
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,513
I'm going to do it without a scroll view, so
我现在要通过不使用滚动视图来实现，然后看看

527
00:21:09,515 --> 00:21:12,549
we can see what that looks like.
是什么样的。

528
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,584
So I'm just gonna say view, addSubView, my ImageView.
我这里写 view.addSubView(ImageView)

529
00:21:17,055 --> 00:21:19,021
Okay, and we know that this is fine to do because
这样做没有问题因为我们知道

530
00:21:19,023 --> 00:21:23,291
viewDidLoad happens after pretty late in the process.
viewDidLoad 会在很晚才回被调用。

531
00:21:23,293 --> 00:21:26,127
Now, I'm not doing anything here that's geometry based.
现在我做的事儿跟尺寸什么的没有关系。

532
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:29,263
I don't set any frames or anything like that, so this is
我没有设置frame或者别的什么，我就仅仅

533
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:31,866
just putting the ImageView in there with whatever frame it
把图片视图加了进来，并不管它的frame是多大，

534
00:21:31,868 --> 00:21:36,269
has, either from the last sizeToFit that it got or
不论它从 sizeToFit得到的尺寸还是仍然是0，

535
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:38,238
it's still zero, zero because it's never been set.
0是因为它还没设置 frame 。

536
00:21:39,274 --> 00:21:40,356
Okay.

537
00:21:40,357 --> 00:21:41,439
So I'm just adding it as a subview there.
我仅仅是加了一个子视图而已。

538
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,977
Now, let's talk about what the model is in this
现在我们还看一下这个视图控制器的

539
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:46,578
view controller.
model是什么。

540
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,363
What is it's model?
它的model。

541
00:21:48,364 --> 00:21:50,147
Look for the model right at the top here.
咱们把model加在最上边。

542
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:54,218
It's model is going to be into public.
model应该是公有的。

543
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,086
It's going to be a public resettable model,
应该是公有并且可以重置的，

544
00:21:56,088 --> 00:21:58,555
which is an image URL.
它是图片的URL。

545
00:21:58,557 --> 00:22:02,091
And it's just going to be an NSURL, so an NSURL is a class
类型是 NSURL，NSURL是用来存储 NSURL 的类，

546
00:22:02,093 --> 00:22:07,363
that holds a URL, like http:// some Stanford.edu something
比如类似 http://Stanford.edu 的东西。

547
00:22:07,365 --> 00:22:09,931
and that's going to be the model, and every time we
这就是我们的model，每次设置它的时候，我们就会得到

548
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:13,068
set the model it's going to get to that image and
它相应的图片然后把

549
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,204
put it in the view, okay?
图片放到视图里。

550
00:22:16,206 --> 00:22:18,205
Everyone understand our nice model here.
大家都明白这个很棒的model了吧。

551
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:20,291
It's a very,
这是一个非常

552
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:22,376
this is a very well designed MVC it has a very clear model.
设计的非常好的MVC，有一个非常清晰的model。

553
00:22:22,378 --> 00:22:25,045
It's clear what it does in its view.
model对于视图的作用也非常清晰。

554
00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:27,881
So one thing that whenever our model is set,
只要我们的model设置了，

555
00:22:27,883 --> 00:22:31,184
though, we want to make sure that we update our UI.
我们就希望UI可以确保被更新。

556
00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:34,954
So when our, if we set a new image URL I'm immediately
如果我们设置了一个新的图片URL，我就会把现有的

557
00:22:34,956 --> 00:22:38,657
going to set whatever existing image we have to nil.
图片设置为空。

558
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:39,791
Because we're changing it,
因为我们要变更图片，

559
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:43,327
and then I'm going to call a function fetchImage.
然后我要调用一个fetchImage方法。

560
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,783
Okay? And

561
00:22:49,784 --> 00:22:51,767
fetchImage is just going to fetch the image that's in
这个方法会根据URL提取图片，

562
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,672
the URL, and load it up into my image view.
并把图片载入到图片视图里。

563
00:22:55,674 --> 00:23:01,877
So, I need this private function fetchImage, okay?
所以我们需有一个私有方法 fetchImage 。

564
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:04,546
So let's talk about how we get an image from a URL.
下面我们看看如何从一个URL里提取图片。

565
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:07,349
If someone give me a URL, how do I get the JPEG image or
如果有人给了我一个URL，我如何才能得到JPEG图片或者

566
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:09,451
whatever that goes along to it?
里面的其他内容？

567
00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:11,152
And it turned out to be quite simple.
非常简单。

568
00:23:11,154 --> 00:23:16,056
First, I'm gonna make sure that my image URL is not nil.
首先，我要确保这个图片的URL不为空。

569
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:18,892
If someone asks me to load up nil,
如果有人要求我载入一个空的URL，

570
00:23:18,894 --> 00:23:20,160
I'm not gonna do anything.
我就什么都不做。

571
00:23:20,162 --> 00:23:23,362
So I'm just gonna basically ignore that.
忽略掉它。

572
00:23:24,465 --> 00:23:27,032
So if it's not nil, so my URL is not nil, I'm gonna go and
如果不为空，我的URL不为空，我就要到

573
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:30,435
go out to the Internet, or if it was a local file,
网上或者本地，因为它也有可能是一个本地

574
00:23:30,437 --> 00:23:33,504
it would be the local file, and get the image data.
文件，去拿到图片的数据。

575
00:23:33,506 --> 00:23:35,806
So I'm gonna say imageData equals, and
这里写 imageData 等于

576
00:23:35,808 --> 00:23:37,608
I can do that with the class NSData.
这里我要用 NSData 类，

577
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:41,111
And you'll remember NSData from a long-ago lecture,
也许你会记得 NSData 在很久以前的一堂课上讲到过，

578
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:43,079
maybe lecture three or four.
第三课或者第四课吧。

579
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:45,481
NSData is just a bag of bits.
NSData 就是一个装比特的包裹。

580
00:23:45,483 --> 00:23:47,783
Right? So I'm gonna reach out on the
所以我现在要到网上

581
00:23:47,785 --> 00:23:51,887
Internet and grab the bag of bits, which is this JPEG file.
把这个包裹抓下来，这个包里就是一个JPEG文件。

582
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:55,123
And I do that by using contentsOfURL initializer
这里用 contentOfUrl 这个初始化器

583
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,325
here, and I just give it the URL.
然后把URL传递给它。

584
00:23:57,327 --> 00:23:59,860
So I can go out and get that.
然后我就在网上得到数据了。

585
00:23:59,862 --> 00:24:01,895
Now this could return nil.
但是这个是有可能返回空值的。

586
00:24:01,897 --> 00:24:04,398
What if I just gave it some bogus URL, 'kay?
如果我传递了一个假的URL呢？

587
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,699
There's no file there.
里边没有文件。

588
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:08,401
So let's check and make sure this is nil.
我们需要检查它是否为空。

589
00:24:08,403 --> 00:24:13,939
So I'm gonna say if the imageData does not equal nil.
这里写 if imageData != nil

590
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:16,675
Why do I keep getting the caps lock there?
我怎么一直开着大写？

591
00:24:16,677 --> 00:24:18,576
I'm not really sure what I'm doing there.
实在不知道我在干嘛。

592
00:24:18,578 --> 00:24:20,511
ImageData does not equal nil,
ImageData 不等于空，

593
00:24:20,513 --> 00:24:23,714
then I can do something about it, else, I can't.
然后我就可以对它做些什么了，如果为空，就不能。

594
00:24:24,683 --> 00:24:29,185
So I could do if let, by the way, here, but
我可以写成 if let，但是我这么写

595
00:24:29,187 --> 00:24:30,286
I'm doing it this way for a reason.
是有原因的。

596
00:24:30,288 --> 00:24:32,621
You'll see a little bit later.
一会儿你就知道了。

597
00:24:32,623 --> 00:24:34,756
So if the imageData's not nil, what am I gonna do?
如果imageData不为空，我要做什么呢？

598
00:24:34,758 --> 00:24:37,492
Well, I need to turn that imageData, that bag of bits,
我要把imageData，装着比特的包裹，

599
00:24:37,494 --> 00:24:39,160
into a UIImage.
转化成一个UIImage对象。

600
00:24:39,162 --> 00:24:42,896
UIImage is the class in iOS that represents an image.
UIImage是iOS里展示图片的类。

601
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,131
So that's really easy to do.
非常容易实现。

602
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:45,565
I'm just gonna say,
我只需要写，

603
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,835
in fact, I'm just gonna assign it to my image.
我要把它赋予image变量里。

604
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:50,836
I'm sorry, we don't need self there.
啊，对不起，这里不需要写self。

605
00:24:50,838 --> 00:24:54,973
I would say image equals UIImage with the data
写 UIImage(data: )

606
00:24:54,975 --> 00:24:57,241
being that imageData.
参数是刚才的imageData。

607
00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:01,846
Okay?

608
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:04,314
Now, otherwise, I'm just gonna say my image equals nil, 'kay?
要不然，我的image就为空。

609
00:25:04,316 --> 00:25:09,252
And, remember, this image equals something like this is
记住我们给image赋值的时候，这里的代码

610
00:25:09,254 --> 00:25:12,288
just calling this right down here to
就会被执行。

611
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,625
set the image in our imageView or whatever, okay?
给我们的图片视图设置一个图片。

612
00:25:16,627 --> 00:25:19,327
And then, of course, this needs to be unwrapped.
当然，data需要解包。

613
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:21,196
But we know we can unwrap it because I
我们知道这个肯定可以解包，因为我之前

614
00:25:21,198 --> 00:25:22,363
checked to make sure it's not nil.
检查过以确保它不为空。

615
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:29,403
Okay, now, this line of code is a very bad line of code for
现在我们回头来看，这行代码是非常有问题的

616
00:25:29,405 --> 00:25:32,472
us because it might go out over the network.
因为它会访问网络。

617
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:35,240
Okay? I could be on cellular.
我可能在用蜂窝网络。

618
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:39,644
This might take ten seconds, or a minute, or it might just
这个操作可能需要10秒，甚至一分钟，也有可能

619
00:25:39,646 --> 00:25:44,448
fail because I have no network connectivity right now, okay?
因为没有网络连接而直接失败。

620
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,651
So this is not a line of code we wanna be executing in
我们不希望在我们的程序里有这样

621
00:25:47,653 --> 00:25:50,020
our program, but
的代码。

622
00:25:50,021 --> 00:25:52,388
we don't know what to do about it right now and I'm gonna
但是我们现在还不知道怎么做，在这次课的后边我会讲到

623
00:25:52,391 --> 00:25:55,759
show you later in the lecture what we can do about it.
应该怎么做。

624
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:58,394
So, for now, we just got this kind of bummer line of
现在我们先把这行会让我们程序变得很慢

625
00:25:58,396 --> 00:26:00,629
code here that's gonna be really slow.
的烂代码放在这。

626
00:26:00,631 --> 00:26:02,531
Our app is gonna be really slow.
我们的程序会因为它变的很慢

627
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:04,833
Although the network at Stanford here is so、
尽管斯坦福大学的网很快所以你可能

628
00:26:04,835 --> 00:26:07,702
fast that it probably won't even seem that slow, but
感觉不到慢，但是

629
00:26:07,704 --> 00:26:10,738
it will be slow cuz I'm gonna grab some pretty huge images.
如果我要下载一些很大的图片，它就会慢下来。

630
00:26:11,974 --> 00:26:16,076
All right, there's one other thing I wanna show here in
下面我可能会给你们看一些关于


631
00:26:16,078 --> 00:26:20,346
terms of view controller life cycle, though, which is,
viewcontroller生命周期的东西。如果

632
00:26:20,348 --> 00:26:23,315
if someone sets my imageURL, okay, and
有人设置了图片的URL。但是

633
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:26,552
I'm not on screen, do I really want to go and
我们的app不在这个界面上，我是不是需要开始用客户的

634
00:26:26,554 --> 00:26:30,155
start using up their cellular data plan, okay?
蜂窝网络开始下载呢？

635
00:26:30,157 --> 00:26:32,357
Probably not, 'kay?
不应该这样，对吧？

636
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:35,693
You gotta remember that people don't have Stanford WiFi
人们不可能在哪都能连到

637
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:37,094
internet everywhere.
斯坦福的wifi。

638
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:40,731
Some people are using cellular, and it costs money.
很多人在用蜂窝网络，是花钱的。

639
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:43,800
So I am not going to actually fetch this
所以如果我不在这个界面上的时候，我不希望

640
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:46,769
image unless I'm currently on screen.
图片开始下载。

641
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,272
So how do I tell if I'm currently on screen?
那我怎么知道是不是在这个界面呢？

642
00:26:50,274 --> 00:26:53,475
Actually I can do that with view.window does not
我可以这么做，view.window != nil

643
00:26:53,477 --> 00:26:55,943
equal nil, 'kay?

644
00:26:55,945 --> 00:26:59,180
So remember view is our top level view in our
view这个属性是我们viewcontroller最顶层的

645
00:26:59,182 --> 00:27:03,217
controller's view ,and .window is the UI window it's in,
视图，它的window属性如果为空，就说明

646
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:08,254
which will be nil if it's not currently on screen, 'kay?
我们现在不在当前的界面上。

647
00:27:08,256 --> 00:27:09,856
But there's a little bit of a problem here,
但是这里有个小问题，

648
00:27:09,858 --> 00:27:14,326
which is what if I'm offscreen and someone sets my imageURL,
如果我不在这个界面，有人设置了图片的URL。

649
00:27:14,328 --> 00:27:16,795
I don't fetch the image, and then I come on screen?
图片不会开始下载，但是如果我之后回来了呢？

650
00:27:16,797 --> 00:27:18,329
Aah!

651
00:27:18,331 --> 00:27:20,631
Then I gotta fetch the image, 'kay?
那么我就应该开始下载，对吧？

652
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:22,366
So where does that happen?
那在哪实现这个部分呢？

653
00:27:22,368 --> 00:27:25,002
Anyone wanna hazard a guess where I would put that code?
有人想猜一下我应该把代码放在哪吗？

654
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:28,971
Nobody?
没有人？

655
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:31,207
ViewWillAppear, exactly, very good.
ViewWillAppear，没错，非常好。

656
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:33,142
So in viewWillAppear down here,
在 ViewWillAppear 里，

657
00:27:33,144 --> 00:27:35,644
I'm gonna say super.viewWillAppear.
先要调用 super.ViewWillAppear。

658
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,549
And then I'm just gonna say, if my image is nil,
然后这里我要写，如果我的图片为空，

659
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:44,551
then fetch the image, 'kay?
那么就开始下载图片。

660
00:27:44,553 --> 00:27:46,253
Now it could be that my image is nil because I
有可能我的图片为空是因为我尝试下载

661
00:27:46,255 --> 00:27:47,687
tried to fetch it and it failed, but
但是失败了，这里就会再试一次，然后

662
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:50,423
it's just gonna try again and fail, that's okay.
可能又失败了，不过这样没问题。

663
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:53,726
But, obviously, my image is not nil,
但是显然如果我的图片不为空，

664
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,361
then I don't wanna fetch it again.
我就不会再下载一次了。

665
00:27:55,363 --> 00:27:58,597
That would be wasting their cellular data even more, okay?
这样会浪费用户的蜂窝网络。

666
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:00,899
So here's a classic example of where we
所以这里是实用 ViewWillAppear 的一个

667
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:02,000
would use viewWillAppear,
经典例子。

668
00:28:02,002 --> 00:28:04,735
because we know it's worth it to go get that data,
因为我们知道我们马上要看到界面，所以在这个点开始从

669
00:28:04,737 --> 00:28:09,639
because we know we're going to appear onscreen, 'kay?
网络上获取数据是必要的。

670
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:10,907
Everybody understand that,
大家都懂了吗？

671
00:28:11,943 --> 00:28:15,277
view controller lifecycle coming to life for you?
对viewcontroller的生命周期了解了吗？

672
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,528
Okay?

673
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:17,778
So that's good. So let's go ahead and run.
很好，我们继续。

674
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,948
So you, actually, let's go ahead and
现在我们要放一个

675
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,549
put a default image in here.
默认的图片。

676
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:23,384
I actually have some URLs.
实际上我已经有一些URL了。

677
00:28:23,386 --> 00:28:28,755
I'm just gonna drag this DemoURL.swift in here.
我要把 DemoURL.swift 这个文件拖进来。

678
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:32,392
And all this DemoURL.swift does is it just defines
这个文件只是有一些我们今天这个演示

679
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:36,395
a bunch of URLs that we're gonna use in our demo today.
用到的URL。

680
00:28:36,397 --> 00:28:39,064
So one of them is Stanford, right here.
其中一个是斯坦福的。

681
00:28:39,066 --> 00:28:41,066
So I'm going to load that up.
我要把它加载进来。

682
00:28:41,068 --> 00:28:48,539
So in my viewDidLoad, I'm gonna say, if my image is nil,
在viewDidLoad里，我要写，如果我的图片为空。

683
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:55,846
then my imageURL equals my DemoURL.Stanford, 'kay?
那么我图片的URL就等于 DemoURL.Stanford 。

684
00:28:55,848 --> 00:28:57,398
So I'm just gonna,
我在

685
00:28:57,399 --> 00:28:58,949
in viewDidLoad, I'm gonna set my imageURL.
viewDidLoad 里设置了我的URL。

686
00:28:58,951 --> 00:29:01,317
Now, it's not gonna actually load this until it
在视图要出现的时候，图片才会真正

687
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,051
will appear.
开始加载。 

688
00:29:02,053 --> 00:29:03,319
That's okay.

689
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:06,789
But I'm just setting it right here, 'kay?
在这设置。

690
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:08,523
And I'm not, this is really for testing anyway.
不过这个只是为了测试。

691
00:29:08,525 --> 00:29:11,292
I probably don't even need to do that just cuz we're gonna
我们一会儿在正式开始之前，

692
00:29:11,294 --> 00:29:14,462
remove this code once we start really not testing and
会删了这行代码。

693
00:29:14,464 --> 00:29:16,964
actually working.

694
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:19,465
So let's go ahead and run this and see what we got.
这里我们运行一下看会发生什么。

695
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:20,734
Oh, so it's not gonna work.
哦，什么都没有。

696
00:29:20,736 --> 00:29:22,802
Okay, so this comes up, it's blank.
是空白的。

697
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:23,970
Why is this blank?
为什么是空白的呢？

698
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:25,871
Well, let's look at our storyboard.
让我们看一下 storyboard 。

699
00:29:25,873 --> 00:29:27,973
Here's the entry point to our storyboard.
这里是 storyboard 的入口。

700
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,608
It's this blank view controller.
它指向一个空的 view controller。

701
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,809
Anyway, we don't want that.
我们不希望这样。

702
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,009
Let's move them over here and have it
把它挪到这，让它从

703
00:29:32,012 --> 00:29:35,847
come into our view controller image view controller here.
我们的图片视图控制器进入。

704
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:37,782
Oh yeah, there we go, we got Stanford.
Oh yeah，我们看到了斯坦福的图片。

705
00:29:37,784 --> 00:29:41,852
That's very nice, but can't scroll around, 'kay?
非常漂亮，但是不能滚动。

706
00:29:41,854 --> 00:29:43,186
Oops.

707
00:29:43,188 --> 00:29:47,023
I can't zoom, can't turn the pinch, nothing.
不能缩放，不能用手指缩放。

708
00:29:47,025 --> 00:29:48,724
Okay, so I can't see it, 'kay?
什么都不能做。

709
00:29:48,726 --> 00:29:50,258
Can't see anything.

710
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,294
So that's, obviously, we need a scroll view, all right?
显然，我们还需要一个滚动视图。

711
00:29:53,296 --> 00:29:55,163
So, let's go ahead and
我们继续

712
00:29:55,165 --> 00:29:59,566
first of all, actually, what should we do first here?
首先，我们应该先做什么呢？

713
00:29:59,568 --> 00:30:02,936
Let's do, let's enhance our user interface a little bit
我们需要增强一下我们的用户界面

714
00:30:02,938 --> 00:30:04,871
more so we can pick other images.
让我们可以选择更多的图片。

715
00:30:04,873 --> 00:30:07,540
I don't wanna just have this Stanford image, I wanna have
我不希望只能看见斯坦福图片，我希望能看见

716
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:09,809
some different images that we can look around in.
一些不同的图片。

717
00:30:09,811 --> 00:30:11,744
So I'm gonna go over here and
我们到这里拖一个

718
00:30:11,746 --> 00:30:14,212
drag out a split view controller.
split view controller

719
00:30:15,448 --> 00:30:17,014
Where's that split view?
在哪呢？

720
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:18,683
Right here.
在这。

721
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:20,351
So let's drag out this splitViewController.
让我们拽一个 splitViewController 出来。

722
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:22,652
And, as usual, with the split view controller, I'm going to,
跟以前一样，在这个 splitViewController，我要。。。

723
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,256
when I zoom out a little here, we can look at it.
我先缩小一点就能看见了。

724
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:28,824
I'm gonna delete a lot of the stuff that came with it here.
我得删掉这些没用的东西。

725
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,692
Keep that one.
留着这个，

726
00:30:30,694 --> 00:30:32,127
We'll delete that.
删掉这个。

727
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:33,828
I'm gonna have,
我需要

728
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:39,600
my image view controller is going to be the detail, 'kay?
让我们的图片视图控制器作为细节视图。

729
00:30:39,602 --> 00:30:41,118
So I made the detail.
细节视图。

730
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,635
I'm gonna make my entry point here be my
我要把入口挪到

731
00:30:42,638 --> 00:30:45,138
split view controller.
splitViewController

732
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:49,575
And I'm gonna have my master be this little one that was in
把之前的那个view controller作为主视图。

733
00:30:49,577 --> 00:30:51,443
here before.

734
00:30:51,445 --> 00:30:54,646
By the way, I just Ctrl+drag there and set this little view
我Ctrl ＋ 拖拽到这个view controller，这是

735
00:30:54,648 --> 00:30:56,681
controller that was there when we first started our app,

740
00:31:05,057 --> 00:31:08,458
In your, in the demo and in your thing, we, you probably
在你们自己做的时候，你们应该选

741
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,061
did this in Editor > Embed In > Navigation Controller, but

742
00:31:12,063 --> 00:31:14,730
you can also do it with Ctrl+drag, 'kay?

758
00:31:54,566 --> 00:31:56,666
the Cassini satellite.
图片。

759
00:31:56,668 --> 00:31:58,734
Okay, that was sent out as Saturn.

oh, that's so bad, it's not even close.
哦，糟糕，完全不对

782
00:32:52,348 --> 00:32:54,648

790
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,906
I think we're good to go there.
我觉得这样可以了，

791
00:33:22,908 --> 00:33:25,375
Yep, frames.
对，frame的警告。

792
00:33:25,376 --> 00:33:27,843
So, let's update our frames, less time.
更新一下frame。

793
00:33:27,846 --> 00:33:30,130
Okay, there we go.
好了，这下对了。

794
00:33:30,131 --> 00:33:32,415
All right, so we've got some nice auto layout there, and so
现在也有了很棒的自动布局，

795
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:35,718
now all we need to do is to segue when these are pressed.
现在我们需要做的就是设置segue，通过点击响应。

796
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,821
We're gonna segue to our Image View Controller down here.
segue到下边的图片视图控制器。

797
00:33:38,823 --> 00:33:42,157
So let's set that up and just Ctrl+drag.
Ctrl ＋ 拖拽连起来。

798
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,126
nope, Ctrl+drag, all right.
不对，Ctrl ＋ 拖拽，对了。

799
00:33:45,128 --> 00:33:46,527
So I'm gonna show detail because in
选择show detail因为

800
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:49,397
the split view I want it to show up on the detail side and
在split view我希望它显示在细节视图上，在iphone上

801
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:51,532
on iPhone it's gonna push,.
就是push。

802
00:33:51,534 --> 00:33:54,668
So there's that one, let's go ahead and set its segue.
我们继续，设置它

803
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:58,871
So this one I'll just call it Earth, 'kay, this one,
就叫它 Earth 吧

804
00:33:58,873 --> 00:34:04,677
down here, show detail we'll call this one Cassini, and
再弄一个show detail，我叫它 Cassini

805
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:12,283
with this one, show detail, we'll call that one Saturn.、
最后一个，叫Saturn

806
00:34:15,455 --> 00:34:18,622
Okay, so there we go, we've got a nice story board here,
ok了，我们现在有了个漂亮的 storyboard。

807
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:21,525
we've got these segues all set up in here all
我们设置好了全部的segue，现在要做的是

808
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:23,927
we need to do is prepare for these segues.
准备他们。

809
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,628
This View Controller right here, okay,
打开view controller。

810
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,965
I'm going to select on this and go here to see its code.
我点这就能看见它的代码。

811
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,767
So here's the code for that View Controller.
这就是view controller的代码。

812
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,236
It's just this blank one that got created when we
这就是我们建立app的时候那个空白

813
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,003
created our app.
的文件。

814
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:38,206
Okay, and all I need in this ViewController is
我要在这实现 prepareForSegue 。

815
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,075
prepareForSegue, nothing more, so I'm gonna prepareForSegue.
仅此而已，实现 prepareForSegue 。

816
00:34:41,077 --> 00:34:44,244
Actually I'm going to make
我得把它弄的宽

817
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:46,713
this quite a bit wider here with these huge fonts.
一点，字体太大了。

818
00:34:47,683 --> 00:34:50,817
And in here I'm going to see if it's a segue to
现在我要检查它是不是要segue到我的

819
00:34:50,819 --> 00:34:53,336
an image ViewController.
图片视图控制器。

820
00:34:53,337 --> 00:34:55,854
So I'm gonna say if I can let image view controller equal my
这里写if let ivc = 

821
00:34:55,857 --> 00:34:58,691
segue's destinationViewController as
segue.destinationViewController as 

822
00:34:58,693 --> 00:35:00,592
an ImageViewController.
ImageViewController

823
00:35:00,594 --> 00:35:01,760
Okay, so we know we're segueing into
现在我们可以确定是segue到

824
00:35:01,762 --> 00:35:03,812
an image view controller.
图片视图控制器。

825
00:35:03,813 --> 00:35:05,863
Then if I can let the identifier equal
然后if let identifier 等于

826
00:35:05,865 --> 00:35:10,100
the segue's identifier, so the identifier's not null,
segue.identifier，这样确保identifier不为空，

827
00:35:10,102 --> 00:35:11,868
then I'm gonna switch on the identifier.
然后对 identifier 作 switch.

828
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,937
This code should all look very familiar to you,
你们应该很熟悉这个了。

829
00:35:13,939 --> 00:35:17,473
and then in case of Earth, 'kay,
然后，如果是 Earth。

830
00:35:17,475 --> 00:35:20,976
we are going to have to set the image URL, 'kay?
我们就要设置图片的URL。

831
00:35:20,978 --> 00:35:23,512
So ivc is an image view controller,
ivc就是我们的图片视图控制器。

832
00:35:23,514 --> 00:35:26,648
its public settable model is the imageURL.
它的公有的可设置的model就是 imageURL。

833
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:30,952
So I'm gonna set that to DemoURL.NASA.Earth.
我把它设置成 DemoURL.NASA.Earth 。

834
00:35:30,954 --> 00:35:33,921
'Kay, I have a nice one ready to go there.
这个做好了。

835
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:38,191
I'm also gonna set the title of that to Earth,
我还要把它的标题设置成 Earth ，

836
00:35:38,193 --> 00:35:42,028
'kay, and then same thing here for Saturn.
下边是Saturn，一样的。

837
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:45,698
It's image view controllers,
这个是图片视图控制器。

838
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,301
imageURL equals the DemoURL.NASA.Saturn.
imageURL 等于 DemoURL.NASA.Saturn 。

839
00:35:49,303 --> 00:35:54,939
ivc.title equals Saturn, and same thing for Cassini.
ivc.title 是 Saturn，下面是Cassini 。 

840
00:36:07,353 --> 00:36:07,951
Let's see.

841
00:36:14,393 --> 00:36:17,927
'Kay, and otherwise we will just break, and
最后如果都不是，就break。什么也

842
00:36:17,929 --> 00:36:19,528
do nothing, okay?
不做。

843
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:22,297
Everybody understand this code?
这些代码大家都能看懂吧？

844
00:36:22,299 --> 00:36:24,399
Hopefully it's completely familiar to you.
希望你们已经非常熟悉了。

845
00:36:24,401 --> 00:36:26,267
Nothing special there at all.
没什么特别的。

846
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:29,470
Okay, so I think that should work.
我觉得应该没问题了。

847
00:36:29,472 --> 00:36:30,470
Let's try it.
试试看。

848
00:36:30,472 --> 00:36:34,607
Hopefully it didn't clean anything.
希望没弄坏什么东西。

849
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,842
All right, so we go back, we've got these things.
我们点返回，看到这些摁钮。

850
00:36:36,844 --> 00:36:37,876
Let's go ahead, oh,
继续，

851
00:36:37,878 --> 00:36:39,745
my auto layout doesn't look very good there.
啊，自动布局貌似不怎么好。

852
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:43,148
Probably messed that up, but anyway, close enough.
可能是弄乱了，不过也差不多了。

853
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,917
Let's go Earth, oh, it didn't work, okay?
点 Earth， 啊，不行。

854
00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:48,986
That's because we have back here,
这是因为，我们回到这，

855
00:36:48,988 --> 00:36:54,591
here in our image controller, we have this test code here.
因为在我们的图片视图控制器，有一些测试代码。

856
00:36:54,593 --> 00:36:56,726
Let's get rid of that, right there.
把测试代码删掉。

857
00:36:56,728 --> 00:36:58,628
Try again.
再试一下。

858
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,796
Right back now, let's look at Earth, and
试试 Earth

859
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:03,766
look how slow this this, you see what I'm talking about?
非常慢，看到没？

860
00:37:03,768 --> 00:37:04,933
Like, hello,
hi

861
00:37:04,935 --> 00:37:08,770
can't do anything, can't click on any buttons.
啥也干不了，也点不了别的摁钮。

862
00:37:08,772 --> 00:37:11,706
Finally, we get this and this does not look like
最后我们看到了图片，貌似不是地球，

863
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:14,775
the Earth to me, looks like a bunch of dim photos.
像是一些很暗的照片。

864
00:37:14,777 --> 00:37:17,711
I don't know what that is how about Cassini?
不知道这是些什么，那Cassini呢？

865
00:37:17,713 --> 00:37:21,882
oh, we got the outer space part of Cassini right, but
啊，我们看到了外太空的部分，

866
00:37:21,884 --> 00:37:26,419
that's all we can see because we need the scroll view now.
但是也只有这些了，我们需要滚动视图。

867
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:27,787
We absolutely have to have the scroll view.
必须要用滚动视图了，

868
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:30,155
These are big images so we can not see anything without it.
如果没有，这些很大的图片，我们什么也看不见。

869
00:37:30,157 --> 00:37:32,891
So let's go back and put our scroll view in here.
咱们回来，加上滚动视图。

870
00:37:34,994 --> 00:37:37,028
All right, so how are we gonna put the scroll view in here?
怎么加入滚动视图呢？

871
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,830
Well, I'm actually gonna put the scroll view in
我要用 storyboard 来加入

872
00:37:39,832 --> 00:37:41,698
using the storyboard.
滚动视图。

873
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,400
So, I'm gonna drag a scroll view in.
拖一个滚动视图进来。

874
00:37:43,402 --> 00:37:44,701
That's kinda a simple way to do it.
应该是比较简单的方法了。

875
00:37:44,703 --> 00:37:47,069
So, let's bounce out here so
缩小一点，

876
00:37:47,071 --> 00:37:49,238
now we're back to our Image View Controller.
来到图片视图控制器。

877
00:37:50,307 --> 00:37:52,207
All right, this is our Image View Controller, and
在这，我要拖

878
00:37:52,209 --> 00:37:54,042
I'm just going to drag out a scroll view.
一个滚动视图进来。

879
00:37:54,044 --> 00:37:55,176
I'm gonna search for
在这里搜索，

880
00:37:55,178 --> 00:37:58,845
it, scroll, there it is, drag it out here.
scroll，啊，在这，拖进来。

881
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:03,182
I'm gonna place it so that it's right on the edges with
这样放，沿着蓝线，这样

882
00:38:03,184 --> 00:38:04,917
the blue lines right there.
就跟边缘对齐了。

883
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:08,487
I'm definitely gonna do Reset to Suggested Constraints.
肯定也是需要重置建议的约束。

884
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:11,256
I'm gonna make sure that works, which it did,
检查一下是不是成功，行了。

885
00:38:11,258 --> 00:38:13,224
'kay, no magic numbers.
没有魔法数字。

886
00:38:13,226 --> 00:38:16,194
Everything looks nice right there, and now I
看上去没问题了，

887
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:20,964
just need to put my image view inside this scroll view right.
现在我需要把我的图片视图放到滚动视图里。

888
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:24,101
So I got this scroll view here all I wanna do is put
我要做的就是这个，把图片视图放到滚动视图

889
00:38:24,103 --> 00:38:25,468
the image view inside of it.
的里边。

890
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,004
So how am I gonna put that imageView inside of it.
我要怎么做呢？

891
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:30,773
That's very, very, very simple I'm just going to
非常非常简单。我只需要给滚动视图一个

892
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,941
create an outlet to this thing.
outlet。

893
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,509
Let's put the outlet right here.
把outlet放在这。

894
00:38:34,511 --> 00:38:39,347
Okay, I'm going to call the outlet scroll view, and
起名叫scrollView，

895
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:42,183
as soon as that outlet is set
设置好了。

896
00:38:42,185 --> 00:38:47,121
in it's did Set I'm going to simply say to.
在didSet里我们要做，

897
00:38:50,693 --> 00:38:52,392
The scroll, well actually, we, you know,
实际上我们已经加上了

898
00:38:52,394 --> 00:38:53,559
we already added the scroll view.
滚动视图。

899
00:38:53,561 --> 00:38:54,994
Let me make this a little easier on you.
我们做的简单一点。

900
00:38:54,996 --> 00:38:58,263
See right down here where we add the image view to
看到这里图片视图已经加到

901
00:38:58,265 --> 00:39:01,049
our view?
我们的视图？

902
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,834
Instead, I'm just gonna add it to the scroll view, 'kay?
相反，我只是把它添加到滚动视图中

903
00:39:03,837 --> 00:39:06,437
So you can build your view hierarchy in view did load.
这样你可以在 viewDidLoad 中建立视图层次关系

904
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:08,172
It's actually a pretty good place to build it,
这里实际上是个很好的地方来创建它

905
00:39:08,174 --> 00:39:10,908
cuz all your outlets are set, so we know this is set, and so
因为你的所有 outlets 都设置好了，我们知道这个已经设置好了

906
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,410
we can build our view hierarchy here, 'kay?
我们可以在这里建立我们的视图层次

907
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:16,446
So I just added the subview to there but I do actually need
我刚才已在那里添加了子视图，但实际上我

908
00:39:16,448 --> 00:39:17,513
this didset here.
需要在这里调用 didset

909
00:39:17,515 --> 00:39:19,348
I need again to make this wider so
我需要再次把这个变宽

910
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:23,985
you can see it because when I set my scroll view what's
这样你们可以看到，因为当我设置我的滚动视图时，

911
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,087
the most important thing to make a scroll view work?
让一个滚动视图工作最重要的事情是什么？

912
00:39:28,257 --> 00:39:29,523
The content size, right.
contentSize，对吧

913
00:39:29,525 --> 00:39:31,024
So when my scroll view gets set,
因此当我的滚动视图被设置了

914
00:39:31,026 --> 00:39:32,392
I need to set the content size, so
我需要设置 contentSize

915
00:39:32,394 --> 00:39:35,962
I'm gonna say scrollView.contentSize, and
所以我要设置 scrollView.contentSize

916
00:39:35,964 --> 00:39:37,697
what size do I want it to be?
我需要设置怎样的大小？

917
00:39:37,698 --> 00:39:39,431
Well I want the content size to be exactly the same size as
好吧，我需要 contentSize 和 imageView

918
00:39:39,434 --> 00:39:40,899
the image view, so
的大小一致

919
00:39:40,901 --> 00:39:45,403
I'm just gonna say imageView.frame.size.
我要设 imageView.frame.size

920
00:39:45,405 --> 00:39:49,674
'Kay, now that's not, oops, equals.
这不是，等于

921
00:39:49,676 --> 00:39:52,643
That's not the only place I need to do this, though, 'kay?
这里不是我需要做这个操作的唯一地方

922
00:39:52,645 --> 00:39:53,944
Any time my image changes,
任何时候我的图片改变了

923
00:39:53,946 --> 00:39:55,779
obviously my image view might change,
显然我的图片视图也可能改变

924
00:39:55,781 --> 00:39:58,214
I need to change the content size of my scroll view.
我需要改变滚动视图的内容大小

925
00:39:58,216 --> 00:39:59,482
So also here.
这里也需要

926
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:04,686
Inside the setter for image I need to set my scrollView's
在 setter 里面，我需要设置滚动视图的

927
00:40:04,688 --> 00:40:10,291
content size equal to the imageView's frame size.
contentSize 等于图片视图的大小

928
00:40:10,293 --> 00:40:12,526
Here I'm going to do something kind of interesting,
这里我要做些有趣的事情

929
00:40:12,528 --> 00:40:15,662
which I actually did in auto layout demo after the fact
这是在我发布代码之后在自动布局

930
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,097
when I posted the code, but
例子中做的

931
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:18,832
I'm going to put a question mark right here.
但我要在这里放个问号

932
00:40:19,801 --> 00:40:22,802
And the reason I'm gonna do that, it allows me to set my
我这样做的原因，我可以在内部设置

933
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:29,007
image internally, even if my outlets have not been set yet.
图片，即使我的 outlets 还没被设置。

934
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:34,512
I know that these outlets are implicitly wrapped optionals,
我知道这些 outlets 都是可选的

935
00:40:34,514 --> 00:40:35,913
and of course that means that you can access them,
当然这意味着你可以访问它们

936
00:40:35,915 --> 00:40:39,249
but the reality is you need to protect against the cases
但事实是你在这些变量可为

937
00:40:39,251 --> 00:40:41,051
where those things might me nil.
nil 的情况下做些保护措施

938
00:40:41,053 --> 00:40:42,452
Like setting your image,
比如设置你的图片

939
00:40:42,454 --> 00:40:45,288
somehow, before that was your set.
某种方式，在你设置前

940
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,256
So, now I don't need to do it here,
现在这里我不需要了

941
00:40:47,258 --> 00:40:48,457
because I'm in viewDidLoad.
因为我在 viewDidLoad

942
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:51,026
And I don't need to do it here because, of course,
我不需要在这里做这些，当然

943
00:40:51,028 --> 00:40:52,494
it just got set.
它已经被设置了

944
00:40:52,496 --> 00:40:54,262
But here, I'm going to do it just to be safe.
但这里，为了安全我需要做这个

945
00:40:54,264 --> 00:40:59,066
Everyone understand that?
每个人都理解了吗？

946
00:40:59,068 --> 00:40:59,933
Okay.

947
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:01,001
So, let's see.
让我们看看

948
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:01,567
It should work.
它应该可以工作

949
00:41:03,971 --> 00:41:06,271
All right here we go, let's go try Cassini.
我们从这里，让我试试 Cassini

950
00:41:06,273 --> 00:41:08,907
Slow, okay.
很慢

951
00:41:08,909 --> 00:41:10,942
Oh yeah, look, oh stars.
看看，星星

952
00:41:10,944 --> 00:41:15,680
Oh, what's that?
这是什么？

953
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:18,716
Oh, look at that.
看这个

954
00:41:18,718 --> 00:41:19,883
Oh, sorry.
抱歉

955
00:41:19,885 --> 00:41:21,051
There it is.
在这里

956
00:41:21,053 --> 00:41:24,620
Oh, oh,.

957
00:41:24,622 --> 00:41:26,856
It's a spacecraft of some sort.
这是某种太空船

958
00:41:26,858 --> 00:41:28,390
Hard to tell, kay?
很难说清楚

959
00:41:28,392 --> 00:41:30,659
We don't really get to see a lot of it, but
我实际上没看到它的大部分

960
00:41:30,661 --> 00:41:31,860
[INAUDIBLE] Cassini.
Cassini

961
00:41:31,862 --> 00:41:34,228
Okay, well obviously we need zooming, kay?
显然我们需要缩放

962
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,630
Because I can't see really what's going on here.
因为我不能看清楚这里所发生的

963
00:41:36,632 --> 00:41:39,199
All right, so let's go back and add zooming.
让我回去，然后添加 zooming

964
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:40,701
Again, very straightforward.
非常简单

965
00:41:40,702 --> 00:41:42,202
Remember, there's only two things you really need to do.
记住，实际上你只需要做两件事情

966
00:41:42,204 --> 00:41:43,903
You gotta set that min max, and
你要设置 min 和 max

967
00:41:43,905 --> 00:41:45,872
you gotta implement that delegate method.
然后你要实现代理方法

968
00:41:45,874 --> 00:41:48,040
Great place to set delegate methods, of course,
这里是实现代理方法的好地方，当然

969
00:41:48,042 --> 00:41:50,009
is in the setter of outlets.
在 outlets 的 setter 中

970
00:41:50,011 --> 00:41:51,877
If you wanna set the delegate of an outlet, so
如果你想设置一个 outlet 的代理

971
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:55,480
I'm gonna set the scrollView's delegate to be myself.
我将设置滚动视图的代理为我自己

972
00:41:55,482 --> 00:41:57,582
Of course I'm gonna have to say that I implemented.
当然我必须实现（代理）

973
00:41:57,584 --> 00:41:58,916
That's the problem here.
这是问题所在

974
00:41:58,918 --> 00:41:59,750
Okay.

975
00:41:59,752 --> 00:42:02,286
We'll do that in a second.
我们一会就做这个

976
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:04,821
While I'm here I'm going to set the minimum zoom scale
这里，我将设置 minimumZoomScale 

977
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:05,455
to 0.03.
为 0.03

978
00:42:05,457 --> 00:42:07,574
This is a very,
这是张非常

979
00:42:07,575 --> 00:42:09,692
very large image that we'll be able to look at here.
非常大的图片，我们可以在这里看到

980
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:12,061
And the maximum zoom scale to 1.0 and
然后 maximumZoomScale 为 1.0

981
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:15,297
maybe these don't wanna be magic numbers.
可能它们不想为神奇的数字

982
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:17,632
Maybe these want to based on the actual size of
可能它们想要根据图片视图的

983
00:42:17,634 --> 00:42:18,599
the imageView.
实际大小

984
00:42:18,601 --> 00:42:20,757
Okay?

985
00:42:20,758 --> 00:42:22,914
So you might want to make it so
所以你可能想要让它

986
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,071
that you can perfectly zoom out to fit the scrollView or
完全缩小以适合滚动视图或

987
00:42:25,074 --> 00:42:26,156
something like that.
其他类似的视图

988
00:42:26,157 --> 00:42:27,239
But I'm just picking numbers here to
但我挑这些数字只是为了

989
00:42:27,242 --> 00:42:28,541
make this code simpler.
让代码简单

990
00:42:28,543 --> 00:42:30,943
So let's go fix the fact about the delegate here.
让我们修改下这里的代理

991
00:42:30,945 --> 00:42:33,779
So I'm just going to go up here and say,
我要到这上面来，我要设置

992
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,614
oh yes, ImageViewController is a UIScrollView delegate.
ImageViewController 为滚动视图的代理

993
00:42:36,617 --> 00:42:38,116
And, as soon as I say that,
一旦我设置了

994
00:42:38,118 --> 00:42:39,884
this warning went away down here, but
这下面的警告就没了

995
00:42:39,886 --> 00:42:41,686
I didn't get a new one that said, oh,
我没有另一个新的（警告）

996
00:42:41,688 --> 00:42:43,120
you don't implement this.
你没有实现这个

997
00:42:43,122 --> 00:42:45,022
And again, cuz this is the old objective C
因为这是老式的 objective C

998
00:42:45,024 --> 00:42:47,457
style protocol where there's optional methods.
风格的协议，这是可选方法

999
00:42:49,027 --> 00:42:50,226
So, I'm going to implement one of
我要实现它们中的一个

1000
00:42:50,228 --> 00:42:52,761
them though which is view for zooming in scrollView.
即 viewForZoomingInScrollView

1001
00:42:52,763 --> 00:42:55,330
Okay, as soon as I typed viewFor,
只要我输入 viewFor

1002
00:42:55,332 --> 00:42:57,032
it knew what I was talking about.
它知道我想输入什么

1003
00:42:57,034 --> 00:42:59,434
And I'm just going to return my imageView because that is
我只要回到图片视图，因为

1004
00:42:59,436 --> 00:43:02,770
the view that's inside the scrollView's content area that
它在滚动视图的内容区域中

1005
00:43:02,772 --> 00:43:03,437
I want to zoom on.
就是我想放大的

1006
00:43:03,439 --> 00:43:05,105
And that's it.
这就是了

1007
00:43:06,174 --> 00:43:08,307
That's all we need to do, so let's go run.
这就是所有我们需要做的，让我们运行下

1008
00:43:10,211 --> 00:43:11,410
Now we should be able to go and
现在我们应该能够

1009
00:43:11,412 --> 00:43:14,346
take a look at Cassini in all of its grandeur.
看到 Cassini 的全部华丽壮美

1010
00:43:14,348 --> 00:43:17,348
I'm just going to hold down Option so that I can pinch.
我要按住 Option 键，这样我可以捏（图片）

1011
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,549
And I'm just pinching in here.
我在这里捏

1012
00:43:19,985 --> 00:43:21,685
Oh there it is. And let's go ahead and
这就是，让我们继续

1013
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:23,286
rotate the other way.
旋转到其他方式

1014
00:43:23,288 --> 00:43:26,122
There we go.
我们看到了

1015
00:43:26,123 --> 00:43:28,957
So we can see it and zoom out a little bit.
因此我们可以看到它缩小了一点点

1016
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,193
We can still scroll in addition to zooming.
我们依然可以在缩放的时候滚动

1017
00:43:32,129 --> 00:43:33,361
Okay? And let's go look at
让我们看看

1018
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:35,430
this Earth thing so
这个 Earth 图片

1019
00:43:35,431 --> 00:43:37,498
we can figure out what the heck is going on with that.
现在我们总算清楚它在干什么了

1020
00:43:41,203 --> 00:43:41,968
So slow.
这么慢

1021
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,169
Okay, so here it is.
这就是了

1022
00:43:43,171 --> 00:43:44,971
Oh, now we can move around and look at things.
让我们移动开，看看

1023
00:43:44,973 --> 00:43:46,172
Let's zoom in on this a little.
让我们在这里缩小一点

1024
00:43:46,174 --> 00:43:49,841
[INAUDIBLE] oh, whoa, it's the Earth.
它是地球

1025
00:43:49,843 --> 00:43:51,543
Woo, okay.

1026
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:54,812
So, yes and as we can imagine, guess what this one is.
既然我们可以想象，猜猜这个是什么

1027
00:43:56,916 --> 00:43:58,616
Pictures of people.
很多人的照片

1028
00:43:58,617 --> 00:44:00,317
So this is actually made up of composites of images of
所以这个实际上是人们向 Cassini 挥手的

1029
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:01,918
people waving at Cassini.
照片拼图

1030
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,988
Kay they're taking pictures of themselves waving, see?
他们在挥手的时候拍的照片

1031
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,523
Hello Cassini.
你好，Cassini

1032
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:09,524
So that's what this composite is made of and
这就是这张拼图的内容

1033
00:44:09,526 --> 00:44:11,559
then I'll push in that Saturn out of there.
我要推动土星离开那里

1034
00:44:11,561 --> 00:44:12,627
'Kay so.

1035
00:44:12,629 --> 00:44:14,795
NASA, pretty cool.
NASA，相当酷

1036
00:44:14,797 --> 00:44:15,929
All right.

1037
00:44:15,931 --> 00:44:17,147
Okay, so that's good.
这很好

1038
00:44:17,148 --> 00:44:18,364
So that's all I'm gonna show for now.
这是我现在想演示的所有内容了

1039
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:20,700
We'll get back and work on the fact that our app is really,
我们一会将返回，然后解决我们 app 相当相当慢的

1040
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:21,768
really slow in a minute.
问题

1041
00:44:22,737 --> 00:44:25,537
Gotta show you some stuff first though.
先给你们看些材料

1042
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:26,672
'Kay, any questions about that?
关于这个有问题吗

1043
00:44:26,674 --> 00:44:29,474
ScrollView's really easy to use, but you just
滚动视图很容易掌握，但你们

1044
00:44:29,476 --> 00:44:32,276
gotta know these particular things like the delegate and
要知道这些特别的东西，比如代理和

1045
00:44:32,278 --> 00:44:35,479
that min max zoom scale and that content size.
minmaxZoomScale 以及 contentSize

1046
00:44:35,481 --> 00:44:36,680
As long as you do those things,
只要你们做了这些事情

1047
00:44:36,682 --> 00:44:38,081
it'll work really great.
它就能工作的相当好了

1048
00:44:39,084 --> 00:44:40,583
All right, so a little aside here.
先把这些放一边

1049
00:44:40,585 --> 00:44:42,285
Just a two minute aside.
只是放一两分钟

1050
00:44:42,286 --> 00:44:43,986
I'm gonna rip through these slides about closures, but
我要讲讲这些幻灯片上的闭包

1051
00:44:43,988 --> 00:44:45,721
there's an important aspect about closure that
这是关于闭包非常重要的方面

1052
00:44:45,723 --> 00:44:46,388
you need to know.
你们需要知道

1053
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:48,090
Kay?

1054
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:49,791
Closures, when you have a closure in your code,
闭包，但你们的代码中有闭包时

1055
00:44:49,793 --> 00:44:53,695
it captures any variables that are used inside
它会捕获闭包中使用的任何外部变量

1056
00:44:53,697 --> 00:44:57,431
the closure from the outer scope, where the thing is,
这个是

1057
00:44:57,433 --> 00:44:59,199
which is a really cool feature.
是非常酷的特点

1058
00:44:59,201 --> 00:45:01,335
That's what makes it a closure really, okay.
这实际上也让它成为了一个闭包

1059
00:45:01,337 --> 00:45:03,570
Is that it captures them, okay.
闭包是这样捕获它们

1060
00:45:03,572 --> 00:45:05,805
You can make incredibly elegant code out of
你可以使用闭包写出难以置信的

1061
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:06,605
this, okay.
优雅代码

1062
00:45:06,607 --> 00:45:08,607
Now here's where I'm going to
现在我要向你们演示

1063
00:45:08,608 --> 00:45:10,608
show you something about the calculator that if you
计算器的一些东西，如果你们

1064
00:45:10,611 --> 00:45:12,644
didn't do this in your assignment, that's good.
在你们的作业没做这个，没关系

1065
00:45:12,646 --> 00:45:14,079
Because in your assignment I wanted you to
因为在你们的作业中，我希望你们

1066
00:45:14,081 --> 00:45:15,613
use delegation, okay.
使用代理

1067
00:45:15,615 --> 00:45:20,384
However, sometimes closures can be a substitute or
然而，有时候闭包可以作为一种替代或者

1068
00:45:20,386 --> 00:45:23,653
a better tool to use than delegation.
是个比代理更好的工具

1069
00:45:23,655 --> 00:45:25,155
Lets look at this code right here.
看这里的代码

1070
00:45:25,157 --> 00:45:26,823
Lets say I have a class called grapher.
我有一个类叫做 grapher

1071
00:45:26,825 --> 00:45:29,258
I'm not going to say what kind of thing it could be
我不打算讲这是什么样的东西

1072
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,660
because some of you haven't turned in your homework yet,
因为你们中有些还没把作业交上来

1073
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:34,329
but lets say I had a grapher, okay.
但我有一个 grapher

1074
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:37,298
And it doesn't have a delegate method or anything it just has
它没有代理方法或其他方法，它只有

1075
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:42,036
a var called yForX whose type is a function.
一个变量叫做 yForX，它的类型是函数

1076
00:45:42,038 --> 00:45:44,605
A function that takes an x and returns a double.
这个函数有个参数 x，并返回 double

1077
00:45:44,607 --> 00:45:45,872
Okay?

1078
00:45:45,874 --> 00:45:47,140
Now that's an optional function.
这是个可选函数

1079
00:45:47,142 --> 00:45:49,742
That's fine, doesn't have to be set in this grapher.
这很好，在 grapher 中不一定需要设置这个函数

1080
00:45:49,744 --> 00:45:51,677
And then what if I just said,
然后如果我

1081
00:45:51,678 --> 00:45:53,611
well I'm going to let the grapher equal a new grapher.
让 grapher 等于一个新的 grapher 会怎样？

1082
00:45:53,614 --> 00:45:56,882
I'm going to let variable graphing brain be
我将让变量 graphingBrain 等于

1083
00:45:56,884 --> 00:45:59,251
a calculator brain instance I just created.
我刚刚创建的 CalculatorBrain 实例

1084
00:45:59,253 --> 00:46:01,886
Then I'm gonna set the program of the graphingBrain I
然后我设置我刚刚创建的 graphingBrain 

1085
00:46:01,888 --> 00:46:04,889
just created to some other program that I wanna graph.
的程序为另一个我想要做图表的程序

1086
00:46:04,891 --> 00:46:08,792
Then I'm just gonna say yForX equals a closure and
然后我只要让 yForX 等于一个闭包

1087
00:46:08,794 --> 00:46:10,527
inside the closure it just says,
然后在闭包内部，只要

1088
00:46:10,529 --> 00:46:13,963
set the variable value to the argument to the closure and
将变量的值传递给闭包的参数

1089
00:46:13,965 --> 00:46:16,032
then return the graphingBrain at evaluate.
然后返回 graphingBrain.evaluate()

1090
00:46:19,637 --> 00:46:22,237
So do you see how by using this,
通过这个你们就知道怎么使用闭包

1091
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:25,173
first of all we have grapher is completely generic.
首先，我们有一个完全普遍的 grapher

1092
00:46:25,175 --> 00:46:27,442
Knows nothing about a calculator brain.
对于 CalculatorBrain 一无所知

1093
00:46:27,444 --> 00:46:29,310
And yet we have this five line,
然后我有这五行

1094
00:46:29,312 --> 00:46:32,613
six lines of code to implement our graphing and
六行代码来实现我们的制图

1095
00:46:32,615 --> 00:46:37,484
it's all incredibly easy to kind of parse what's going on.
这一切都非常容易解析发生了什么

1096
00:46:37,486 --> 00:46:40,053
Now this works because the closure,
这个能起作用是因为闭包

1097
00:46:40,055 --> 00:46:41,421
that little thing in the curly braces,
即在大括号里的小东西

1098
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:45,257
captured the little graphing brain that I created.
捕获了我创建的小 graphingBrain

1099
00:46:45,259 --> 00:46:47,793
Okay, so that every time disclosure is called,
因此每次闭包被调用

1100
00:46:47,795 --> 00:46:51,396
every time, you know, grapher one to yForX.
每次，你们知道的，grapher 一个给 yForX

1101
00:46:51,398 --> 00:46:53,832
It keeps reusing this graphing brain over and over and over.
它一直保持重复使用这个 graphingBrain

1102
00:46:53,834 --> 00:46:55,133
Which is exactly what I want because this
这正是我想要的，因为这个

1103
00:46:55,135 --> 00:46:57,068
graphing brain's got the right program in it.
graphingBrain 在它里面获得了正确的程序

1104
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:58,869
It just keeps calling it over and over.
它只是保持不断调用它

1105
00:46:58,871 --> 00:47:00,570
It doesn't create a new one every time, it just keeps
它并不是每次都创建一个新的，它只是

1106
00:47:00,572 --> 00:47:03,039
reusing it because it captured it from the outer scope.
重复使用它（graphingBrain），因为它从外部范围捕获了它

1107
00:47:04,409 --> 00:47:05,975
Everyone understand what I mean by capture?
每个人都理解我所说的捕获了吗？

1108
00:47:07,345 --> 00:47:09,678
Now, this is really cool and really elegant,
这相当酷，相当优雅

1109
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,946
it looks really awesome, it is awesome, but
看起来棒极了，太棒了，但

1110
00:47:11,948 --> 00:47:13,214
there are some dangers.
有些危险

1111
00:47:13,216 --> 00:47:14,415
Okay?

1112
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:16,767
Capture danger.
捕获危险

1113
00:47:16,768 --> 00:47:19,118
The problem is, if a closure captures a pointer to
问题是，如果一个闭包捕获了一个指向某个东西的

1114
00:47:19,121 --> 00:47:23,056
something and that something has a pointer back to
指针，而这个东西有个指针指回

1115
00:47:23,058 --> 00:47:26,225
the closure, now you have a loop.
闭包，这样你们就有了一个环

1116
00:47:26,227 --> 00:47:28,094
A memory cycle that's going to keep them both in
一个内存周期，这将导致它们永远被

1117
00:47:28,096 --> 00:47:29,695
memory forever.
保留在内存中

1118
00:47:29,697 --> 00:47:31,597
Okay? Kind of
像

1119
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,498
like the memory cycle we were talking about before.
我之前讲过的内存周期

1120
00:47:33,499 --> 00:47:35,399
This is easy to have happen in a closure.
这在闭包内很容易发生

1121
00:47:35,402 --> 00:47:36,901
This is what it looks like, so
它就像这样

1122
00:47:36,903 --> 00:47:39,137
here's another example here of closures.
这里是另一个闭包的例子

1123
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:40,871
I've got this class called Foo.
我们称这个类为 Foo

1124
00:47:40,873 --> 00:47:44,508
It's got one property which is a function called action.
它有一个叫做 action 的函数属性

1125
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:47,678
It's got another function called show,
它有另一个函数叫做 show

1126
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,448
which takes an integer and shows it, prints it.
这个函数接收一个整型输入，然后输出它

1127
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,784
And then it's got a method called setupMyAction, and
然后它有个方法叫做 setupMyAction

1128
00:47:54,786 --> 00:47:57,319
setupMyAction has a local variable, x,
setupMyAction 有个本地变量，x

1129
00:47:57,321 --> 00:47:58,654
which is an integer.
x 是个整型

1130
00:47:58,656 --> 00:48:02,157
That it assigns that action.
它分配了那个 action

1131
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:03,608
[COUGH].

1132
00:48:03,609 --> 00:48:05,058
Function, property to a closure.
函数，一个闭包属性

1133
00:48:05,061 --> 00:48:08,462
Inside that closure it uses the x.
它在闭包里面使用了 x

1134
00:48:08,464 --> 00:48:10,464
That's cool, it captures x.
这很酷，它捕获了 x

1135
00:48:10,466 --> 00:48:12,065
This will actually work.
这将能工作

1136
00:48:12,067 --> 00:48:13,800
This will print 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
这将输出 1，2，3，4，5，6，7，8，9，10

1137
00:48:13,802 --> 00:48:15,435
You can see the doMyAction10times at
你可以看到下面的 doMyAction10times

1138
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:17,137
the bottom.
函数

1139
00:48:17,138 --> 00:48:18,838
If you set up my action it will do it because the x
如果你调用 setupMyAction()，它可行，因为

1140
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,839
gets captured by the closure and
x 已被闭包捕获，然后

1141
00:48:20,841 --> 00:48:23,041
every time the closure get executed.
每次闭包都被执行

1142
00:48:23,043 --> 00:48:25,276
[COUGH]. It increments that x and
它递增 x

1143
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:26,744
counts to 10.
然后累计到 10

1144
00:48:26,746 --> 00:48:29,947
It's also cool because it's capturing self.
捕获本身也很酷

1145
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,549
Because I'm using myself to show the number,
因为我使用我自己来显示这个数字

1146
00:48:32,551 --> 00:48:34,217
by calling self.show.
通过调用 self.show

1147
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:36,419
But here's where the danger comes in.
但这也是危险的来源

1148
00:48:36,421 --> 00:48:38,555
Okay?

1149
00:48:38,556 --> 00:48:40,690
Because self has a pointer to the closure and
因为 self 有个指针指向闭包，然后

1150
00:48:40,692 --> 00:48:43,859
the closure inside has a pointer back to self.
闭包内部有个指针指回 self

1151
00:48:43,861 --> 00:48:46,729
Now, when you write a closure you'll notice that any
当你们写一个闭包时，你将注意到任何

1152
00:48:46,731 --> 00:48:49,931
time you call methods it makes you put self,
时候你调用方法，它都要你输入 self

1153
00:48:49,933 --> 00:48:51,833
makes you say self dot.
让你输入 self.

1154
00:48:51,835 --> 00:48:53,501
That's because it wants you to be clear.
这是因为它要让你清楚知道

1155
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:56,904
You are capturing self when you call show.
在你调用 show 时，你正在捕获你自己

1156
00:48:56,906 --> 00:48:58,105
Okay?

1157
00:48:58,107 --> 00:49:01,174
Now, this is a problem, this class
这是一个问题，这个 Foo

1158
00:49:01,176 --> 00:49:04,043
Foo and this closure are pointed to each other, they
类，和这个闭包互相指向对方，它们

1159
00:49:04,045 --> 00:49:06,779
will stay in memory forever, they can never be released.
将永远保存在内存中，它们永远不会被释放

1160
00:49:06,781 --> 00:49:08,914
How do we fix that problem?
我们如何修复这个问题

1161
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:10,282
Well, we can actually say,
实际上我们可以

1162
00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:15,553
when we make a closure, do not capture this variable in here.
当我们创建一个闭包时，别在这里捕获这个变量

1163
00:49:15,555 --> 00:49:17,088
Okay?

1164
00:49:17,089 --> 00:49:18,622
You do that by saying, [COUGH] unowned,
你通过使用 unowned 来实现

1165
00:49:18,624 --> 00:49:22,359
whatever the variables you don't want to be captured.
不管变量是什么，你都不想捕获

1166
00:49:22,361 --> 00:49:24,094
Okay? You just put it right at
你必须把它放在

1167
00:49:24,095 --> 00:49:25,828
the beginning of the closure, before the in.
闭包的最开始，在 in 之前

1168
00:49:25,831 --> 00:49:27,097
Okay? If you have arguments,
如果你有参数

1169
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:29,031
you put it right before the, in, there.
你把它放在 in 前面，这里

1170
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:31,900
That will make it work.
这样它就能工作

1171
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:34,369
You can also say weak self.
你也可以使用 weak self

1172
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:36,254
Which is a little different.
这个有点不同

1173
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,138
That will make the self be a weak pointer in there.
这将使得 self 为一个弱指针

1174
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,875
We learned about weak pointers in the lecture when we
在我们讲代理时我们学习了

1175
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:42,876
talked about delegation.
弱指针

1176
00:49:42,878 --> 00:49:43,944
So weak would work, too.
所以 weak 也可行

1177
00:49:43,946 --> 00:49:46,280
It wouldn't do it.
它不能够

1178
00:49:46,281 --> 00:49:48,615
The difference between unowned is that pointer doesn't have
无主引用和弱引用的区别是，指针若不是一个

1179
00:49:48,617 --> 00:49:51,184
to be an optional that can be set to nil.
可选型，那么它可以被设置为 nil

1180
00:49:51,186 --> 00:49:52,786
It can just be anything.
它可以是任何东西

1181
00:49:52,787 --> 00:49:54,387
You just guarantee that self will never become nil.
你只要保证 self 永远不会变成 nil

1182
00:49:54,389 --> 00:49:56,388
So, for the lifetime of this closure,
因此，在这个闭包的生命周期

1183
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:58,824
self can never become nil.
self 永远不会变成 nil

1184
00:49:58,826 --> 00:50:00,042
Okay?

1185
00:50:00,043 --> 00:50:01,259
Now, self can be released from the heap,
现在，self 能够在堆中被释放

1186
00:50:01,261 --> 00:50:03,061
which will release the closure now, from the heap.
这将从堆中释放闭包

1187
00:50:03,063 --> 00:50:04,095
That's great, but
非常棒，但

1188
00:50:04,097 --> 00:50:06,463
that closure can never be executed while self,
在 self，即 Fool 为 nil 时，闭包将

1189
00:50:06,465 --> 00:50:07,831
this Foo thing, is nil.
永不被执行

1190
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:09,499
Which is fine, because it's only used inside Foo,
很好，因为他只在 Foo 内部使用

1191
00:50:09,501 --> 00:50:10,600
[COUGH] That would never happen.
这永远不会发生

1192
00:50:11,536 --> 00:50:12,167
Okay?

1193
00:50:12,169 --> 00:50:13,619
Unowned self.
无主 self

1194
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,070
This is all covered in the documentation that you
这全都可以在文档中查阅，你们

1195
00:50:15,072 --> 00:50:17,038
were supposed to have read, but, you might have
应该读过了，但，你们可能

1196
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,307
not really understood this, or glossed over it, so I'm
没真正理解它，或忽略了它，因此我

1197
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:22,276
just revisiting it to tell you that [COUGH] It's important.
只是重新审视它，告诉你们这很重要

1198
00:50:22,278 --> 00:50:23,243
Okay. Because we're going to
因为我们将在这门课程中

1199
00:50:23,245 --> 00:50:24,845
start using closures more and
越来越多地使用闭包

1200
00:50:24,847 --> 00:50:28,981
more in this class and you will be capturing values and
你们将捕获变量

1201
00:50:28,983 --> 00:50:31,350
some of them will point back to the closure.
有些会指回closure

1202
00:50:31,352 --> 00:50:32,551
Okay?


1203
00:50:32,553 --> 00:50:36,088
[COUGH] Okay, that's it.
就是这样

1204
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:37,822
Next is multithreading.
下一个是multithreading

1205
00:50:37,824 --> 00:50:38,690
Okay. Yes, question.
是的，有问题

1206
00:50:38,692 --> 00:50:40,358
Is there an example, could you give
例如，能不能举一个

1207
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,893
an example other than self where it would point back?
除了它自己可指回的例子？

1208
00:50:42,895 --> 00:50:46,596
I think about that swift reference document has a whole
我想Swift参考文档里面有一个大的

1209
00:50:46,598 --> 00:50:50,333
big, long example, so I would just refer you to that.
完整的例子，所以我觉得你应该回去看那个

1210
00:50:50,335 --> 00:50:51,501
Any other questions about that?
还有其他关于那个的问题吗

1211
00:50:51,503 --> 00:50:53,002
[COUGH] Okay.
Okay

1212
00:50:53,004 --> 00:50:57,305
Multithreading, how many people in here have done some
Multithreading，这里有多少人

1213
00:50:57,307 --> 00:50:59,541
programming in a multithreaded environment before?
之前在多线程环境下编过程的？

1214
00:51:02,779 --> 00:51:05,413
More than half, that's more than usual, so that's good.
超过一半，比一般情况多，很好

1215
00:51:05,415 --> 00:51:07,381
All right, then this will all be pretty easy for
好的，这对你们来说

1216
00:51:07,383 --> 00:51:08,682
you to understand.
非常好理解

1217
00:51:08,683 --> 00:51:09,982
Those of you who haven't, it will be a struggle.
这对没有过多线程编程经历的同学可能稍微有些难

1218
00:51:09,985 --> 00:51:12,318
The first time you do it, I'm sure all of you can attest,
你们第一次做这个，你们可以作证

1219
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,355
it's a little bit harder to understand what's going on.
你们理解这个可能会有些困难

1220
00:51:16,357 --> 00:51:17,990
It's actually fairly simple.
这实际上相当简单

1221
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:22,227
What's going on here is, in iOS there are multiple queues.
这里发生的是，在iOS里有多重队列

1222
00:51:22,229 --> 00:51:23,761
A queue meaning like a queue at
一个队列表示像是一个在

1223
00:51:23,763 --> 00:51:26,497
the movie where people lined up to go see a movie.
电影院人们排着队去看一部电影

1224
00:51:26,499 --> 00:51:29,233
A queue in a computer science sense is just a list of things
一个队列在计算机科学里就像是一个

1225
00:51:29,235 --> 00:51:32,469
where things go into the front of the queue, go into the back
东西可以进入队列前面或者后面

1226
00:51:32,471 --> 00:51:35,071
of the queue rather and they get pulled off the front.
或者被拉到队列最前面

1227
00:51:35,073 --> 00:51:40,176
It's a queue of functions, basically closures usually.
这就是一个函数队列，基础的closures

1228
00:51:40,178 --> 00:51:41,544
Okay.
Okay

1229
00:51:41,545 --> 00:51:42,911
That are sitting there waiting to run.
就坐在那等着运行

1230
00:51:42,913 --> 00:51:47,749
Each of these queues has it's own threads to run
每一个队列都有一个自己的线程去运行这些队列

1231
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:50,151
these queues, to process the things on the queues.
去处理队列里的东西

1232
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,854
That makes this a multithreaded environment.
这就造就多线程环境

1233
00:51:53,856 --> 00:51:55,322
Now, there's a very,
这里有个非常非常重要的

1234
00:51:55,324 --> 00:51:58,158
very important queue called the main queue.
队列叫做主队列

1235
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,227
This main queue is a serial queue, meaning it
主队列是个串行队列

1236
00:52:01,229 --> 00:52:04,597
pulls these functions off the queue one at a time.
这说明主队列一次从队列里拉出一个函数

1237
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:06,865
It never runs [COUGH] Two of them at the same time.
它从来不会同一时间一次运行两个函数

1238
00:52:06,867 --> 00:52:08,734
Okay. They're serial, one at a time.
是连续的，一次一个

1239
00:52:08,736 --> 00:52:13,071
And all UI activity has to happen on the main queue.
所有的UI活动都必须发生在主队列

1240
00:52:13,073 --> 00:52:16,841
So if you ever wanted to have a function or closure,
所以当你想要一个函数或是closure

1241
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:20,344
that is executing some code, that did anything with the UI,
这就会执行某些代码，这就会做任何关于UI的事

1242
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:21,812
you have to put it on the main queue.
你必须把他放在主队列

1243
00:52:21,814 --> 00:52:24,681
It can only execute on the main queue.
这只能在主队列里执行

1244
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:30,519
This is how basically the UI is protected
这就是UI是如何被从被混入多线程的环境中

1245
00:52:30,521 --> 00:52:33,422
from getting messed up in the multithreaded environment.
被根本上保护的

1246
00:52:33,424 --> 00:52:34,823
It has this main queue.
它获得了主队列

1247
00:52:34,825 --> 00:52:35,857
Okay? So the main queue,
所以主队列

1248
00:52:35,859 --> 00:52:37,225
very, very important.
非常非常重要

1249
00:52:37,227 --> 00:52:38,726
The main queue never wants to
主队列绝对不想

1250
00:52:38,728 --> 00:52:44,031
be doing anything that might block NS data contents of URL.
做任何可能阻塞包含URL的NSData的

1251
00:52:44,033 --> 00:52:46,066
That should never be in the main queue.
所以这绝对不要出现在主队列里

1252
00:52:46,068 --> 00:52:48,868
So we're going to have to get that off the main queue.
所以我们要把那个从主队列中拿出来

1253
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:50,436
All the code that you write normally in
所以你通常写在你的

1254
00:52:50,438 --> 00:52:53,272
your MVC that's all happening on the main queue.
MVC里的代码都发生在主队列里

1255
00:52:53,274 --> 00:52:55,841
View did load, view will appear, all that stuff,
View did load, view will appear，所以东西

1256
00:52:55,843 --> 00:52:57,609
all happening on the main queue automatically for you,
所有都为你自动的在主队列里发生了

1257
00:52:57,611 --> 00:52:59,544
you don't have to do anything special.
不用特地去做什么

1258
00:52:59,546 --> 00:53:01,996
Okay?
Okay?

1259
00:53:01,997 --> 00:53:04,447
But, there are other queues that iOS will create for you
但是iOS还会在你需要的时候为你创建其他队列

1260
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:06,750
as you need, and we're going to show you how those work.
我会给你们展示这些是如何做到的

1261
00:53:07,953 --> 00:53:10,153
First of all, how do execute a function or
首先，如何在另外一个队列里

1262
00:53:10,155 --> 00:53:11,821
a closure on another queue?
执行一个函数或是closure？

1263
00:53:11,823 --> 00:53:14,790
Well, you do that with this function [COUGH] Called,
你用这个函数来做到

1264
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:15,958
dispatch_async.
叫做dispatch_async

1265
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,510
Okay?
Okay?

1266
00:53:17,511 --> 00:53:19,061
So you say dispatch_async, the argument,
所以就有dispatch_async 参数

1267
00:53:19,063 --> 00:53:21,529
there's two arguments, a queue and a closure.
这有两个参数，一个队列一个closure

1268
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:24,265
The first argument is the queue.
第一个参数是队列

1269
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:26,533
I'm using the trailing closure syntax here to
我在这用了trailing closure语法

1270
00:53:26,535 --> 00:53:28,869
put the closure outside the parentheses there but
来把closure放到了括号外面

1271
00:53:28,871 --> 00:53:31,171
you just specify what queue you want to
但你只要指明你想用哪个队列

1272
00:53:31,173 --> 00:53:33,706
execute the closure on and then you pass it to closure.
来执行closure，然后你再传递closure

1273
00:53:34,876 --> 00:53:36,442
Okay? And the closure takes no
Okay?closure没有参数

1274
00:53:36,444 --> 00:53:39,711
arguments, returns no arguments and that's it.
不返回参数，就是这样

1275
00:53:39,713 --> 00:53:40,612
That's how you do it.
这就是你的做法

1276
00:53:40,614 --> 00:53:42,080
Couldn't be easier.
不能再简单

1277
00:53:42,081 --> 00:53:43,547
dispatch_async on the queue you want.
dispatch_async就在你想要的队列上了

1278
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:46,217
So how do you get the queue that you want?
那么你怎么获得你想要的队列呢？

1279
00:53:46,219 --> 00:53:48,886
Well, you get the main queue using this function
你可以通过这个函数获取主队列：

1280
00:53:48,888 --> 00:53:52,089
dispatch_get_main_queue and that returns the main queue.
dispatch_get_main_queue，然后就能返回主队列

1281
00:53:52,091 --> 00:53:54,257
There's also an object-oriented way to do it,
也有个面向对象的方式去做到

1282
00:53:54,259 --> 00:53:56,125
NSOperationQueue.mainQueue.
NSOperationQueue.mainQueue.

1283
00:53:57,595 --> 00:53:58,794
You got this queue and
你获得这个队列

1284
00:53:58,796 --> 00:54:01,730
here's an example of putting something on the main
这有个把一些东西放进

1285
00:54:01,732 --> 00:54:04,733
queue dispatch_async, [COUGH] notTheMainQueue,
主队列的例子dispatch_async （notTheMainQueue）

1286
00:54:04,735 --> 00:54:07,602
something, and then inside there [COUGH] You could
在这个里面

1287
00:54:07,604 --> 00:54:10,538
say dispatch_async_main_queue.
你可以说dispatch_async_main_queue

1288
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:13,173
This is how you do multithreading programming.
这就是你如何做到多线程编程

1289
00:54:13,175 --> 00:54:15,175
Those lines of code right there.
这些代码在这

1290
00:54:15,177 --> 00:54:19,278
I want to do something that doesn't block the UI, so
我想做一些不阻塞UI的事

1291
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,313
I dispatch it to notTheMainQueue,
我就把他发送进notTheMainQueue

1292
00:54:21,315 --> 00:54:23,249
some other queue,
一些其他的队列

1293
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,184
[COUGH] I'll talk about how to get those queues in a second.
我一会会说道如何获取那些队列

1294
00:54:25,186 --> 00:54:28,887
Then I do it, go do something like NSdata contents of URL,
然后我做一些像是包含URL的NSData

1295
00:54:28,889 --> 00:54:30,621
blocks, whatever.
blocks之类的

1296
00:54:30,623 --> 00:54:33,758
When it's done, I need to talk back to the main queue to
当这做完的时候，我要再说回主队列

1297
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,094
update my UI with the image I got or something like that.
用图片或者类似的东西来更新我的UI

1298
00:54:37,096 --> 00:54:37,928
The way I do that is [COUGH]
我做这些的方法是

1299
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:40,263
I dispatch back to the main queue.
我发送回主队列

1300
00:54:40,265 --> 00:54:42,531
So you nest these calls to the dispatch.
所以你把那些调用都发送回去

1301
00:54:43,801 --> 00:54:45,884
Okay?
Okay?

1302
00:54:45,885 --> 00:54:47,968
You're basically running code on another queue and when
你只是把代码运行在另外一个队列里

1303
00:54:47,971 --> 00:54:51,006
it wants to dock back to the main queue it just posts or
当他想对接进主队列的时候他只是

1304
00:54:51,008 --> 00:54:53,741
puts some code back on the main queue.
发送或者放了些代码回到主队列

1305
00:54:53,743 --> 00:54:55,443
Now, the main queue might be busy.
现在，主队列可能正在处理一些事情

1306
00:54:55,445 --> 00:54:57,711
But when it's done it's a serial queue but
但当这做完的时候，这是个串行队列

1307
00:54:57,713 --> 00:55:02,082
eventually it will get to this block and it will run it.
但最后还是会获取这个block并继续运行

1308
00:55:02,084 --> 00:55:03,549
Okay?
Okay?

1309
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:04,684
Everybody understand that?
所有人都懂了吗

1310
00:55:04,686 --> 00:55:06,051
That's it.
就是这样

1311
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,153
It's so simple really, actually when you see it,
这真的很简单，事实上当年看的时候

1312
00:55:08,155 --> 00:55:09,387
it's almost too simple.
这真的好简单

1313
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,522
The code, when you write it, it's so simple you
你在写这些代码的时候，因为太简单了

1314
00:55:11,524 --> 00:55:14,325
can get confused and forget that you're in a multithreaded
你甚至会忘记你是在多线程环境里

1315
00:55:14,327 --> 00:55:16,860
environment, but this is really, those lines of
但这真的是多线程

1316
00:55:16,862 --> 00:55:18,862
code you're seeing right there at the bottom, that is
你看到的底下的这些代码

1317
00:55:18,864 --> 00:55:25,335
the fundamental multithreaded programming syntax in iOS.
这就是iOS中最基础大多线程编程语句

1318
00:55:25,337 --> 00:55:27,103
How do you get these other queues,
怎么获得其他队列，

1319
00:55:27,105 --> 00:55:30,305
you don't want to run on the main queue.
你不想在主队列中运行的

1320
00:55:30,307 --> 00:55:32,574
You get a queue from the system by asking for
你通过向系统申请一个恰当档次的service

1321
00:55:32,576 --> 00:55:34,809
a certain quality of service.
来获取队列

1322
00:55:34,811 --> 00:55:36,110
And the four qualities of service,
有四个档次的service

1323
00:55:36,112 --> 00:55:37,511
there's user interactive,
这是user interactive

1324
00:55:37,513 --> 00:55:39,646
which is I'm going to do something off the main queue,
表示我将要在主队列外做一些事情

1325
00:55:39,648 --> 00:55:41,715
but the user really wants this done fast, and
但用户想非常快的处理它

1326
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:43,016
it's not going to take very long.
不能耽误太久

1327
00:55:43,018 --> 00:55:44,150
So do it right now.
所以现在就做

1328
00:55:44,152 --> 00:55:45,818
Okay? So it's a high
Okay?所以这是个

1329
00:55:45,819 --> 00:55:47,485
priority queue for things that go really fast.
高优先级的队列来让事情处理的很快

1330
00:55:47,488 --> 00:55:50,522
Then there's USER_INITIATED which is the user just
下一个是USER_INITIATED，是一个

1331
00:55:50,524 --> 00:55:53,692
asked for this, but I know it's going to take a long time
用户请求这个，但我知道这要很长时间

1332
00:55:53,694 --> 00:55:55,694
fetching an image off the network,
去从网络抓取图片

1333
00:55:55,696 --> 00:55:59,364
we would USER_INITIATED, but it's still pretty important.
我就会用USER_INITIATED，但这也很重要

1334
00:55:59,366 --> 00:56:02,166
Then there's utility, which is I'm just doing something.
下一个是utility，是我只是做一些事情

1335
00:56:02,168 --> 00:56:03,734
The user didn't just ask me to do this.
用户没有让我去做

1336
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:05,035
But it's just something I
但我只是

1337
00:56:05,037 --> 00:56:08,505
need to do in the background processing things or whatever.
需要做一些后台进程之类的事

1338
00:56:08,507 --> 00:56:11,908
But it is something that matters right now to the user.
但这是一些现在就关系到用户的事

1339
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,176
So it would be nice if it returned somewhat soon, but
如果现在就能返回一些东西那就最好了

1340
00:56:14,178 --> 00:56:16,211
it's not like got to have it.
但不会去主动获取这个

1341
00:56:16,213 --> 00:56:18,513
And then there's background which is like things that
下一个是background

1342
00:56:18,515 --> 00:56:20,482
are not concerned with what the user is doing right now.
像是一个不关心用户现在在做什么的事

1343
00:56:20,484 --> 00:56:23,584
Like oh I'm pre-fetching some data, updating some database,
比如我正在预抓取一些数据，更新数据库

1344
00:56:23,586 --> 00:56:26,320
cleaning up a database, doing stuff in the background.
清楚数据库，在后台做一些事

1345
00:56:26,322 --> 00:56:28,255
It really has nothing to do with the user doing now,
这真的跟用户现在做的事没关系

1346
00:56:28,257 --> 00:56:29,956
you understand what I mean?
你理解我的意思吗

1347
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:30,990
Just background task.
只是后台任务

1348
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,827
So you create a quality of service,
所以你建立一种级别的service

1349
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:37,129
you do that with this really odd int.
你用一个奇怪的int去做

1350
00:56:37,131 --> 00:56:38,797
One of these constants above there,
上面的其中一个常数

1351
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:41,800
.value, close parentheses, okay.
.value，闭括弧

1352
00:56:41,802 --> 00:56:44,035
For historical reasons, they have them put a nice,
因为历史原因，他们在swift里有个很好看

1353
00:56:44,037 --> 00:56:45,870
new UI in there Swift, which is interesting.
的新UI，很有趣

1354
00:56:45,872 --> 00:56:47,271
But anyway, you do that.
不管怎样，你就是做了这个

1355
00:56:47,273 --> 00:56:49,089
And then you just say,
然后

1356
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:50,906
queue equals dispatch_get_global_queue with
queue equals dispatch_get_global_queue with

1357
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:53,076
that quality of service, comma 0.
that quality of service, comma 0.

1358
00:56:53,078 --> 00:56:56,412
That comma 0 is reserved for future use, okay?
那个0留着以后会用到

1359
00:56:56,414 --> 00:56:57,146
And that's it.
就是这样

1360
00:56:57,148 --> 00:56:58,547
Now you have another queue.
现在你有了另外一个队列

1361
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:00,916
You can now dispatch async to it, and
你现在可以dispatch async给它

1362
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:02,517
be running code off the main queue.
并且在主队列外运行代码

1363
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:04,919
Simple as that.
就是这么简单

1364
00:57:05,988 --> 00:57:07,788
You can create your own serial queues too.
你可以建立自己的串行队列

1365
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:09,222
I'm not going to talk about that really, but
我不准备讲那个

1366
00:57:09,224 --> 00:57:11,524
you might have something where these queues that I'm
但你可能会在我上面提到的

1367
00:57:11,526 --> 00:57:13,109
talking about at the top,
几种service中

1368
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:14,693
these quality service based ones, are concurrent.
同时用到

1369
00:57:14,696 --> 00:57:17,896
So actually a single queue, like the user interactive
所以一个单独的队列，像是user interactive队列

1370
00:57:17,898 --> 00:57:20,032
queue, could actually have multiple threads running,
可以真的多线程运行

1371
00:57:20,034 --> 00:57:21,066
working on it at the same time.
同时在上面工作

1372
00:57:21,068 --> 00:57:22,533
If you have a multi-core processor they can
如果你有个多核处理器

1373
00:57:22,535 --> 00:57:25,936
even actually be working on them.
它可以真的在上面工作

1374
00:57:25,938 --> 00:57:27,871
But mostly it's time sharing,
但大多数情况是分时的

1375
00:57:27,873 --> 00:57:30,540
time slicing between the various threads.
时间分给了数个线程

1376
00:57:30,542 --> 00:57:32,142
But, anyway, you can do a serial 1.
但是你可以做一个serial 1

1377
00:57:32,144 --> 00:57:34,410
And you would do that only if you wanted to do something off
只有当你想在主队列外

1378
00:57:34,412 --> 00:57:38,014
the main thread that something depends on the next things,
做一些事的时候，这些事根据下面的事区分

1379
00:57:38,016 --> 00:57:39,065
depends on the next things.
根据下面的事区分

1380
00:57:39,066 --> 00:57:40,115
So you want to want to do them serially or
所以你想连续的去做

1381
00:57:40,117 --> 00:57:41,283
you want to throttle.
或者你想可控速度的去做

1382
00:57:41,285 --> 00:57:43,251
Like you're fetching a bunch of images, but
比如你想要抓去一些图片

1383
00:57:43,253 --> 00:57:45,119
you don't want to bombard, you know,
但你又不想让他们占了全部网速

1384
00:57:45,121 --> 00:57:47,922
Flicker or whoever you're requesting the images from
Flicker或者任何你想用上百个问题

1385
00:57:47,924 --> 00:57:49,056
with hundreds of questions.
来请求图片的网站

1386
00:57:49,058 --> 00:57:50,624
You're just going to do them one at a time.
你只想一次做一个

1387
00:57:50,626 --> 00:57:52,058
And they're going to appear in the UI one at a time.
任何他们就会一次在UI上显示一个

1388
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,427
So you can do your own
所以你用dispatch_queue_create

1389
00:57:54,428 --> 00:57:56,795
serial queues with dispatch_queue_create.
自己做一个串行队列了

1390
00:57:56,798 --> 00:57:57,363
Okay?
Okay?

1391
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:01,099
You can also use the multi-threading stuff to
你以后也可以

1392
00:58:01,101 --> 00:58:02,834
do something in the future.
用多线程去做一些事

1393
00:58:02,836 --> 00:58:03,567
Okay? You do that with
你通过

1394
00:58:03,569 --> 00:58:04,968
this dispatch after.
稍后发送这个做到

1395
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:07,404
It's kind of odd again.
这又有点奇怪了

1396
00:58:07,406 --> 00:58:11,174
The arguments are kind of weird, you do this Int 64
参数有些奇怪，Int 64

1397
00:58:11,176 --> 00:58:15,111
delay in seconds times double insect per min insect per
delayInSeconds*Double...

1398
00:58:15,113 --> 00:58:18,914
milliseconds dispatch time now delay, blah blah.
...(念语句)

1399
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:23,118
You create this basically time dispatched_time t
你只是最基本的

1400
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,421
that is in the future and then you just say
用dispatched_time创建了队列

1401
00:58:26,423 --> 00:58:31,058
dispatch after that amount of time on to the main queue.
在之后的一段时间会发送到主队列

1402
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,793
So you're almost always doing dispatch after on
所以你差不多经常要

1403
00:58:32,795 --> 00:58:34,578
the main queue.
稍后发送到主队列

1404
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:36,362
It's rare that you'd be on another queue
你在别的队列做这个真的很罕见

1405
00:58:36,365 --> 00:58:39,065
because those other queues are kind of
因为另外一个队列

1406
00:58:39,067 --> 00:58:41,768
concurrent running queues and such.
事同时发生在运行队列的

1407
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:45,571
Anyway it's more likely, I want to put up an alert in
这更像如果用户十秒钟什么都不做

1408
00:58:45,573 --> 00:58:49,274
ten seconds if the user hasn't done something, or
我就显示一个警告

1409
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:50,942
something like that.
或者类似的

1410
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,544
Which is kind of a weird UI, but anyway.
是一种奇怪的UI

1411
00:58:53,546 --> 00:58:55,913
You never want to block the main queue saying oh wait,
你绝对不要想阻塞主队列，说：嘿，等下

1412
00:58:55,915 --> 00:58:58,349
20 seconds and then it will be able to do this.
20秒，然后就可以做这个了

1413
00:58:58,351 --> 00:59:00,350
But you want to be able to notify it.
但是为了提示这个

1414
00:59:00,352 --> 00:59:02,085
And there's tons and
并且有很多

1415
00:59:02,086 --> 00:59:03,819
tons of stuff that I'm not even going to talk about, but
很多的东西我还没讲到

1416
00:59:03,822 --> 00:59:06,155
you can do readers and writers.
你可以做readers 和 writers

1417
00:59:06,157 --> 00:59:07,757
You can protect critical sections of
你可以保护你代码的

1418
00:59:07,759 --> 00:59:08,891
your code doing this.
关键部分去做这个

1419
00:59:08,893 --> 00:59:10,592
You can do synchronous dispatch.
你可以做synchronous dispatch

1420
00:59:10,594 --> 00:59:12,494
Okay, instead of asynchronously firing these
代替异步去执行

1421
00:59:12,496 --> 00:59:13,795
things off to put on the queues.
这个队列

1422
00:59:13,797 --> 00:59:15,763
You can wait for them to execute.
你可以等待他们去执行

1423
00:59:15,765 --> 00:59:17,014
All that stuff.
所以的东西

1424
00:59:17,015 --> 00:59:18,264
You won't need any of that for this class probably.
你可能不需要他们中的任何一项

1425
00:59:18,267 --> 00:59:20,667
The things I showed you, that's the basics of it.
我给你们看的，是最基础的

1426
00:59:20,669 --> 00:59:21,935
That's probably all you're going to need.
这可能就是你们需要的全部

1427
00:59:22,937 --> 00:59:25,921
'Kay?
Okay？

1428
00:59:25,922 --> 00:59:28,906
There are APIs in iOS that are multi-threaded.
这在iOS中的API是multi-threaded

1429
00:59:28,909 --> 00:59:30,275
So, you've got to be careful.
所以你要小心

1430
00:59:30,277 --> 00:59:31,676
If you're doing something, and
如果你做了什么

1431
00:59:31,678 --> 00:59:33,644
it seems like this might be multi-threaded,
可能会是多线程的

1432
00:59:33,646 --> 00:59:35,146
this seems like it might take a little while,
这就表示可能要一会功夫

1433
00:59:35,148 --> 00:59:36,513
like it's gonna access the network or
可能要获取网络

1434
00:59:36,515 --> 00:59:38,181
something like that.
一类的事情

1435
00:59:38,183 --> 00:59:39,916
Then you want to read the documentation and
任何你就要读文档

1436
00:59:39,918 --> 00:59:42,485
see, are you giving it a block, for
看是否让他阻塞了

1437
00:59:42,487 --> 00:59:45,087
example, that's going to be executed off the main thread?
比如，是不是要执行完主现场了？

1438
00:59:45,089 --> 00:59:47,990
Because in that block, if you want to do something with
因为在这个阻塞里，如果你想要做一些UI的事

1439
00:59:47,992 --> 00:59:50,192
the UI you have to post back to the main thread.
你需要发送会主线程

1440
00:59:51,361 --> 00:59:52,060
Okay? So here's what
Okay?所以这就是

1441
00:59:52,062 --> 00:59:54,762
that looks like for example.
例子看起来的样子

1442
00:59:54,763 --> 00:59:57,463
Here is an API, this is the NSURL session API.
这有个API，这个NSURL session API

1443
00:59:58,567 --> 01:00:00,967
The thing in yellow is all that really matters.
黄字非常重要

1444
01:00:00,969 --> 01:00:04,337
It lets you download a file from a URL.
它让你从一个URL中下载一个文件

1445
01:00:04,339 --> 01:00:05,905
And it does it asynchronously.
而且是异步的去做

1446
01:00:05,907 --> 01:00:08,907
And you give it a block, which is the completion handler.
你用completion handler给它一个block

1447
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:11,176
So when it's done, it invokes your block,
当它做完了，它会唤醒你的block

1448
01:00:11,178 --> 01:00:12,844
and it's got some arguments there.
并且这会获取一些参数

1449
01:00:12,846 --> 01:00:16,114
It moves the file to a local URL that you can open.
这会移动文件到一个你可以打开的本地URL

1450
01:00:16,116 --> 01:00:19,316
You get HTTP response, you can get an error, et cetera.
你获取HTTP应答，你看你会得到一个error或者别的什么

1451
01:00:21,053 --> 01:00:24,054
So, you want to do something in there to update the UI,
所以，你想要在这做一些事来更新UI

1452
01:00:24,056 --> 01:00:26,422
cause you got the file back, and can you?
因为你取回了文件，那么你可以吗？

1453
01:00:26,424 --> 01:00:29,425
No, you can't, because that's not on the main queue,
不，你不可以，因为那个不在主队列里

1454
01:00:29,427 --> 01:00:32,728
however you can put dispatch async in there.
但你可以放一个dispatch async在这

1455
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:33,995
Okay, so this is exactly the same code,
所以是完全一样的代码

1456
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:35,530
I just add dispatch async in there.
我只是在这加了dispatch async

1457
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:39,834
All right?
All right?

1458
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:41,201
So that's example where you dispatch a.
这就是你在哪放dispatch async的例子

1459
01:00:41,203 --> 01:00:43,537
That is the exactly the same thing as I showed you on that
这就是我刚才在第一张课件给你们看的东西

1460
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:46,006
very first slide, it's just that it's wrapped inside an
只是包含了一个iOS API

1461
01:00:46,008 --> 01:00:48,508
iOS API instead of just your own dispatch to another queue.
而不是发送到另外一个队列

1462
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:50,443
Okay.
Okay.

1463
01:00:50,445 --> 01:00:52,111
All right so.
所以

1464
01:00:52,113 --> 01:00:56,048
Again, a demo's worth of vowels and words.
一个值得仔细说的例子

1465
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:59,617
So let's go look what it looks to make an Imaginarium there.
所以来看看看如何做一个Imaginarium

1466
01:01:00,687 --> 01:01:03,287
Or Christini I guess I called it this time.
这次我猜我叫他Christini

1467
01:01:03,289 --> 01:01:06,456
Let's make this thing be multi-threaded.
来把它变成多线程

1468
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:09,592
So we know that it's really bad UI, it blocks every
我们知道这是个糟糕大UI，每次我们请求大图片

1469
01:01:09,594 --> 01:01:13,196
time we ask for these big images, it's completely stuck.
都会阻塞，真的很不好

1470
01:01:13,198 --> 01:01:16,766
So where we fetch the image right here,
所以我们在哪获取图片呢？

1471
01:01:16,768 --> 01:01:20,535
we need to be doing that on a different thread.
我们要在另外一个线程里做

1472
01:01:20,537 --> 01:01:21,236
All right? So how are we
All right?

1473
01:01:21,238 --> 01:01:22,270
going to do that?
所以我准备做这个

1474
01:01:22,272 --> 01:01:24,038
We'll we're going to do exactly what I
我们就是要做

1475
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,456
did in the slides there.
之前课件里讲的

1476
01:01:25,457 --> 01:01:26,873
Which is I'm going to create one of these quality of
我要在这建立一个之前说的

1477
01:01:26,876 --> 01:01:28,342
service things here, okay.
service中的一个

1478
01:01:28,344 --> 01:01:29,275
First of all, I don't need to do
首先，我如果image URL为空

1479
01:01:29,277 --> 01:01:32,445
anything if my image URL is nil.
我什么都不要做

1480
01:01:32,447 --> 01:01:33,679
So if it's not nil though,
如果不是

1481
01:01:33,681 --> 01:01:35,614
then I'm going to let my quality of service equal,
如何就让qos等于

1482
01:01:35,616 --> 01:01:42,887
let's go ahead and do this so you can see lots of code here.
继续，你可以看到很多代码

1483
01:01:42,889 --> 01:01:44,606
All right,
All right

1484
01:01:44,607 --> 01:01:46,324
I'm gonna select this quality of service to this weird thing
我要选这些service中的一个

1485
01:01:46,326 --> 01:01:49,760
int and the quality of service I want is going to be this
有些奇怪的service

1486
01:01:49,762 --> 01:01:54,331
user initiated because the user has asked for something.
我想要这个user initiated，用户请求一些东西

1487
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:56,232
It's not gonna be quick,
这不会很快

1488
01:01:56,234 --> 01:01:58,935
but I want it to be done as soon as it can.
当要经快的完成

1489
01:01:58,937 --> 01:02:01,170
Because the user's waiting for it basically.
因为用户在等着

1490
01:02:01,172 --> 01:02:03,505
So that's gonna be my quality of service there.
这就是我要的service

1491
01:02:03,507 --> 01:02:06,675
And then I'm just going to say dispatch, async.
然后就是dispatch async

1492
01:02:06,677 --> 01:02:08,943
The queue I want is a global queue, so
我要的是一个global queue

1493
01:02:08,945 --> 01:02:12,113
I'm going to say get global queue.
获取一个global queue

1494
01:02:12,115 --> 01:02:15,783
I'm gonna actually use a different one of these,
我要用一个完全不一样的

1495
01:02:15,785 --> 01:02:16,483
hold on.
等等

1496
01:02:16,485 --> 01:02:18,351
Identifier global queue.
Identifier global queue

1497
01:02:18,353 --> 01:02:20,153
And use this one,
用这个

1498
01:02:20,155 --> 01:02:23,289
which is the one that takes the quality of service there.
一个要选service的

1499
01:02:23,291 --> 01:02:24,556
So quality of service.
quality of service

1500
01:02:26,527 --> 01:02:29,461
Not caps, Q O S, there we go.
qos，好了

1501
01:02:29,463 --> 01:02:32,764
The flags are always zero there, and here's my block.
这里的 flags 参数总是 0，这里是 block

1502
01:02:32,766 --> 01:02:34,616
All right?
看到了吗？

1503
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:36,467
So let's double-click to do that.
让我们双击这个 block

1504
01:02:36,469 --> 01:02:38,802
I'm going to put that outside, you know,
把它放到括号的外部

1505
01:02:38,804 --> 01:02:42,673
the trailing closure syntax here I'm going to use.
我将会使用的是尾随闭包语法

1506
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:46,042
Now inside here, now I can do the things that slow.
在这个 block 内部，我可以处理一些较慢的工作

1507
01:02:46,044 --> 01:02:49,712
So, let's put all of this inside here, to start.
把下面的这些都放进来

1508
01:02:49,714 --> 01:02:51,047
Even though we know that's not going to be good.
即使这可能不太正确

1509
01:02:51,049 --> 01:02:52,014
All right?
好

1510
01:02:52,016 --> 01:02:54,616
So, I dispatched async in here.
在这里 dispatch_async

1511
01:02:54,618 --> 01:02:57,786
Notice that it's already complaining that you gotta put
注意 Xcode 已经发现了错误

1512
01:02:57,788 --> 01:02:59,120
self in here.
你需要在这里加上 self

1513
01:02:59,122 --> 01:03:01,489
That's because I put this inside of a closure.
这是因为我把它放入一个闭包内部

1514
01:03:01,491 --> 01:03:04,191
And it's capturing self because I'm accessing my
因为我尝试获取 imageBar 

1515
01:03:04,193 --> 01:03:05,959
image bar here.
所以它捕获到了 self

1516
01:03:05,961 --> 01:03:07,060
All right, so I can fix that one.
我把它改正过来

1517
01:03:07,062 --> 01:03:09,696
Let's go ahead and do that here as well.
这个也一样

1518
01:03:09,698 --> 01:03:11,897
Extra parenthesis.
多余的括号

1519
01:03:11,899 --> 01:03:13,065
Okay, so that's good.
这看起来还不错

1520
01:03:13,067 --> 01:03:14,232
Now, this is fine,
很好

1521
01:03:14,234 --> 01:03:16,835
this is that thing that's going to be slow.
这种很慢的工作

1522
01:03:16,837 --> 01:03:19,037
It's happening on another thread right now,
我们已经把它放到另一个线程处理了

1523
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,571
that's great.
这很棒

1524
01:03:20,573 --> 01:03:23,340
But this is not great because here, this is going to
但是也有些问题

1525
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:26,410
cause UI stuff to happen all over the place, right?
这里会涉及 UI 的元素

1526
01:03:26,412 --> 01:03:27,744
Look at all this UI stuff it's going to do.
看到了吗？这里的 UI 元素

1527
01:03:27,746 --> 01:03:31,581
So I cannot do this on this thread.
我不能在这个线程处理它们

1528
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:39,622
So I just have to dispatch it back to the main thread.
所以我需要把它们放回到主线程运行

1529
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:45,594
The main two actually, and
实际上是主线程的队列

1530
01:03:45,596 --> 01:03:51,899
again I'm going to use the trailing closure syntax there.
在这里我还会使用尾随闭包的语法

1531
01:03:51,901 --> 01:03:55,769
That's exactly why they designed it that way.
这就是为什么他们会这样设计线程

1532
01:03:55,771 --> 01:03:57,187
All right, so
好

1533
01:03:57,188 --> 01:03:58,604
now I'm dispatching back to the main queue.
我已经把它们放回了主队列

1534
01:03:58,607 --> 01:04:00,507
That's good and all is well.
一切都很好

1535
01:04:00,509 --> 01:04:01,808
And that's it.
就是这样

1536
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:03,442
That's all it took.
这些就是需要进行的工作

1537
01:04:03,444 --> 01:04:07,179
So you can see the multi-threaded, it's like,
在一系列工作之后，你可以到多线程是什么样了

1538
01:04:07,181 --> 01:04:11,916
after you've made it, except for this weird end thing.
除了这些奇怪的 Int 操作

1539
01:04:11,918 --> 01:04:14,719
It made about the minimal amount of codes you could
它可以让你进行有可能

1540
01:04:17,957 --> 01:04:18,789
possibly be.
最少量的编程工作

1541
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:20,857
All right, this is not quite right,
不过还是有点问题

1542
01:04:20,859 --> 01:04:22,809
we're not quite done here, but
这里还是没有完成

1543
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:24,760
let's go see if this has fixed our problem at least.
让我们一起看看，这是否至少已经修复了之前的问题

1544
01:04:24,763 --> 01:04:26,496
So here we are, so I'm going to go Earth.
选择 Earth

1545
01:04:26,498 --> 01:04:28,297
Now look, I can go back.
看到没？我可以返回了

1546
01:04:28,299 --> 01:04:30,299
My UI is completely active.
UI 是时刻相应的

1547
01:04:30,301 --> 01:04:32,467
I can do anything I want,
我可以做任何想做的工作

1548
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:35,737
even though it's still loading that thing in the background.
即使程序仍在后台载入图片

1549
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:38,806
And eventually, once it's kind of sucked it all down,
一旦最终完成了载入

1550
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:40,941
it shows it to me, and I can zoom in on it.
它就会展示给我，我可以缩放它

1551
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:42,642
Here we go.
就是这样

1552
01:04:44,946 --> 01:04:49,615
Okay, so that's exactly what we want.
这就是我们想要的效果

1553
01:04:49,617 --> 01:04:53,252
And it took virtually no code on our part.
事实上我们没写多少代码

1554
01:04:53,254 --> 01:04:54,886
However, it's not quite right.
然而，还是有点问题

1555
01:04:56,223 --> 01:04:59,023
And if you have experienced multi-threading, you're gonna
如果你曾经了解过多线程

1556
01:04:59,025 --> 01:05:00,691
immediately understand what I'm talking about here.
你会立刻明白我接下来将要叙述的内容

1557
01:05:01,694 --> 01:05:05,328
This is kind of lulls you into thinking,
这有点哄骗你的意思

1558
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:08,465
oh I got this right okay ready to go next problem.
这我已经做好了，我可以处理下一个问题了

1559
01:05:08,467 --> 01:05:13,269
But what happens if this image data takes a long time to
但是如果花费很长时间下载图片数据的时候

1560
01:05:13,271 --> 01:05:17,239
come back and in the mean time the user asks for
用户请求了一张新的图片

1561
01:05:17,241 --> 01:05:17,906
a different image.
会出现什么问题？

1562
01:05:21,411 --> 01:05:24,712
Well, we argue, I can't do that of course because we
这里可能会有些争论

1563
01:05:24,714 --> 01:05:27,448
segue to and from so we are always creating new nvc but
这不会发生的，因为每次 segue 的时候都创建了一个新的 MVC

1564
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:29,182
imagine a new nvc that stayed on screen.
但是想象一个出现在屏幕上的新 MVC

1565
01:05:29,184 --> 01:05:30,784
And there was a way to click a button and
有一个按钮

1566
01:05:30,786 --> 01:05:32,318
it would load a new image.
点击它就会载入一张新的图片

1567
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:37,956
Well, this thing might come back after the next request
在下次请求之后，这种情况就可能发生了

1568
01:05:37,958 --> 01:05:41,226
and show the user the old image they wanted instead of
程序就会展现给用户上一次请求的图片

1569
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:42,260
the new one they'd asked for.
而不是他们希望的新图片

1570
01:05:42,262 --> 01:05:43,861
Do you see the problem?
能想清楚这个问题吗？

1571
01:05:43,863 --> 01:05:45,296
So, this is where modern
这里的多线程问题就

1572
01:05:45,297 --> 01:05:46,730
threading gets a little hard on your brain.
比较难以理解

1573
01:05:46,733 --> 01:05:47,965
It's like, oh, what?
就好像，什么？

1574
01:05:47,967 --> 01:05:49,399
These things are happening in a different order
这些发生的顺序都不一样

1575
01:05:49,401 --> 01:05:50,900
because they're happening in different threads,
因为它们发生在不同的线程中

1576
01:05:50,902 --> 01:05:53,136
different threads of execution here.
不同的线程在执行

1577
01:05:53,138 --> 01:05:54,270
So how do we fix that?
我们怎么能修复这个问题呢？

1578
01:05:54,272 --> 01:05:56,405
It's actually fairly simple to fix.
实际上非常简单

1579
01:05:56,407 --> 01:05:59,841
When this image data comes back, okay,
当这个图片数据请求完成以后

1580
01:05:59,843 --> 01:06:03,545
we're just gonna check and see if the URL that caused it
我们验证一下引发图片请求的 URL

1581
01:06:03,547 --> 01:06:07,315
to be fetched is the one we currently want.
是不是我们当前想要的

1582
01:06:07,317 --> 01:06:12,252
So I'm just going to go here and say, if the url, which is
这里我会这样，if url 

1583
01:06:12,254 --> 01:06:18,291
this url right here, which was captured by this, okay?
也就是这里的 url

1584
01:06:18,293 --> 01:06:23,963
So if this url up here equals self.imageURL, in other words,
验证一下上面的 url 是否等于 self.imageURL

1585
01:06:23,965 --> 01:06:26,565
the url that my user currently wants,.
换句话说，是不是用户当前想要的

1586
01:06:27,801 --> 01:06:29,200
Then I'm going to do this.
是的话，就这样做

1587
01:06:30,203 --> 01:06:31,368
Otherwise I'm going to
否则

1588
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:32,869
completely ignore this response.
我会完全忽视这次回应

1589
01:06:34,139 --> 01:06:37,373
Okay, this JPG file came back but the user has moved on.
JPG 文件下载完成，但是用户已经不需要了

1590
01:06:37,375 --> 01:06:39,542
They don't even care about this.
用户已经不在乎下载好的图片了

1591
01:06:39,544 --> 01:06:42,044
So you see what I'm talking about, where you've got to
这里我叙述的关于多线程内容

1592
01:06:42,046 --> 01:06:43,645
think a little bit with this multithreader.
你们应该多思考一些

1593
01:06:43,647 --> 01:06:44,779
You can't just throw the code in there and
你不能写完代码往这一放

1594
01:06:44,781 --> 01:06:45,880
go, oh yeah, it works.
哦，它起作用了，就不管了

1595
01:06:45,882 --> 01:06:47,982
You have to think about things might be happening,
你应该思考一些可能将要发生的事情

1596
01:06:47,984 --> 01:06:51,051
taking a long time, cuz they're happening separately.
思考地久一点，因为它们不是同一时刻发生的

1597
01:06:53,555 --> 01:06:55,538
So that's good.
还不错

1598
01:06:55,539 --> 01:06:57,522
There's really nothing to show there because our UI doesn't
这里没什么好展示的

1599
01:06:57,525 --> 01:06:59,925
really allow us to specify a different image.
因为 UI 不许我们列举一个不同的图片

1600
01:06:59,927 --> 01:07:02,061
When we click back and forth in our UI,
当我们在 UI 中后退或者前进

1601
01:07:02,063 --> 01:07:05,697
we're creating a new MVC every time because we're segue.
会创建新的 MVC，因为我们是通过 segue 连接的

1602
01:07:05,699 --> 01:07:09,401
So the new MVC is obviously got its own environment.
所以新的 MVC 有它自己的环境

1603
01:07:09,403 --> 01:07:11,869
So the last thing I want to show you is our UI is not
最后一点我想要展示给你们的是

1604
01:07:11,871 --> 01:07:16,206
very good because it has a lot of blank white screen in it.
UI 看起来不太好，因为屏幕上有太多空白的地方

1605
01:07:16,208 --> 01:07:18,475
Okay, right here, blank white screen, it's like oh,
在这里，空白的屏幕

1606
01:07:18,477 --> 01:07:19,676
blank white screen, what's going on?
用户会说，空白的屏幕？发生了社么？

1607
01:07:19,678 --> 01:07:22,011
Mm, I don't know, what's happening here?
我不知道这里发生了什么

1608
01:07:22,013 --> 01:07:23,062
I don't know.
我不知道

1609
01:07:23,063 --> 01:07:24,112
You see what I mean, it's like
你们应该懂我什么意思

1610
01:07:24,115 --> 01:07:26,548
I can't even tell what's really going on in my UI.
我不能分辨 UI 到底发生了什么

1611
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:28,016
It'd be nice if when I clicked here I
如果我点击这里

1612
01:07:28,018 --> 01:07:31,486
got like a spinning wheel that would say I'm working on it.
出现一个旋转的圆圈，告诉我正在处理，就会好很多

1613
01:07:31,488 --> 01:07:33,521
I'm trying to get that thing, okay.
我正在获取图片

1614
01:07:33,523 --> 01:07:35,222
So we want a nice little spinning wheel in here.
所以在这里我们需要一个旋转的圆圈

1615
01:07:35,224 --> 01:07:37,458
So how do we do the spinning wheel?
我们怎样实现呢？

1616
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:39,726
Spinning wheel, very easy to do.
很容易实现

1617
01:07:39,728 --> 01:07:42,896
We're going to go to our story board right here.
选择 storyboard

1618
01:07:42,898 --> 01:07:45,765
Screen realty management is a challenge on
在这么小的屏幕上展示这么多内容

1619
01:07:45,767 --> 01:07:47,566
this small screen.
很有挑战

1620
01:07:47,568 --> 01:07:50,903
And I'm just going to drag out a little spinning wheel
我直接向 UI 中

1621
01:07:50,905 --> 01:07:52,138
into my UI.
拖入一个旋转的圆圈

1622
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:53,372
And this is a great chance for me to
向你们展示一下 Document Outline 如何使用

1623
01:07:53,373 --> 01:07:54,606
show you a little bit of how to use the document outline.
这里是个很好的机会

1624
01:07:54,608 --> 01:07:57,008
And you'll see why.
你们会知道原因的

1625
01:07:57,010 --> 01:08:00,611
So here the spinning wheel is called the activity indicator.
旋转的圆圈在这里被称为 Activity Indicator View

1626
01:08:00,613 --> 01:08:03,047
So I'm going to type activity, there it is.
在这里输入 activity

1627
01:08:03,049 --> 01:08:07,284
Little spinning wheel, drag it out, and going to put it here.
从这里拖出这个小圆圈，放到这里

1628
01:08:07,286 --> 01:08:10,987
Now when I drag that out, it kind of looks like okay good,
放置完毕后，UI 看起来还不错

1629
01:08:10,989 --> 01:08:14,557
works, got a spinning wheel on there, I'm ready to go.
这里有了一个小圆圈，已经可以开始接下来的工作了

1630
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,392
But actually,
但是实际上

1631
01:08:16,393 --> 01:08:18,226
something very bad happened when I dragged that out.
拖拽完毕后，发生了很不好的事情

1632
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:21,096
And if I look in the document line, I'll see what it is.
在 Document Outline 你就会发现

1633
01:08:21,098 --> 01:08:25,066
Which is that this spinning wheel
这个小圆圈被添加成了

1634
01:08:25,068 --> 01:08:28,869
was added as a SubView of the ScrollView.
ScrollView 的 SubView（子视图）

1635
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:33,040
Because I dragged it out on top of the ScrollView, so
因为我把它放到了 ScrollView 的上面

1636
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:34,374
it added it as a SubView so
所以它被添加成了 SubView

1637
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:36,943
that mean it's going to be in that content area.
这就表示它会出现在 ScrollView 的区域

1638
01:08:36,945 --> 01:08:39,578
We don't want that, we want this thing to be floating on
我们不希望这样，我们希望它

1639
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:42,881
top of the scroll view.
漂浮在 ScrollView 的顶部

1640
01:08:42,883 --> 01:08:45,050
It's very hard to fix it in here.
在这里很难修复这个问题

1641
01:08:45,052 --> 01:08:46,618
Cuz it's like where do you drag it?
你能把它拽到哪里去？

1642
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:48,519
The scroll view's everywhere.
这里到处都是 ScrollView

1643
01:08:48,521 --> 01:08:49,854
You can't get it.
你不能获取到它

1644
01:08:49,856 --> 01:08:52,656
So this is what the document outline is great for.
然而这就是 Document Outline 擅长的地方了

1645
01:08:52,658 --> 01:08:53,957
Watch this.
仔细看

1646
01:08:53,958 --> 01:08:55,257
I'll take this right out of the scroll view.
我把它拽出 ScrollView

1647
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:56,793
Boom, it's out.
它已经出去了

1648
01:08:56,795 --> 01:08:58,561
Now this puts it behind the scroll view,
现在它被放到了 ScrollView 的下面

1649
01:08:58,563 --> 01:09:00,262
because I told you the subview's list,
因为我告诉过你们这个 SubView 列表

1650
01:09:00,264 --> 01:09:01,330
the top things are in the back.
列表最上面的元素是在 UI 最底层的

1651
01:09:01,332 --> 01:09:03,265
So I'll just put the scroll view on top.
所以我把 ScrollView 放到列表最上面

1652
01:09:03,267 --> 01:09:05,266
So now I have the scroll view in the back,
现在 ScrollView 已经在 UI 最下面了

1653
01:09:05,268 --> 01:09:06,067
indicator in the front.
小圆圈在前面了

1654
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:08,469
Okay?
OK？

1655
01:09:08,471 --> 01:09:10,237
What about constraints?
约束怎么解决？

1656
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:11,971
Oh, the constraints here are hard to put too,
这里的约束也很难设置

1657
01:09:11,973 --> 01:09:13,306
because every time you kind of drag,
因为每一次你拖拽的时候

1658
01:09:13,308 --> 01:09:14,807
it keeps dragging it to the scroll view.
它总被拽到 ScrollView 里

1659
01:09:14,809 --> 01:09:17,142
Well, I can do constraints in here as well.
我也可以在这里处理约束问题

1660
01:09:17,144 --> 01:09:20,245
Let's drag the indicator view up to
把小圆圈拽到

1661
01:09:20,247 --> 01:09:22,047
the view above the scroll view.
ScrollView 上面的 view

1662
01:09:22,049 --> 01:09:24,015
Right, our NVC's view.
MVC 的 view

1663
01:09:24,017 --> 01:09:27,451
And I'm just going to say I want this to be centered
我希望它在这个 view 的

1664
01:09:27,453 --> 01:09:30,087
horizontally and vertically in that view.
垂直中央和水平中央

1665
01:09:31,356 --> 01:09:33,890
Boom, I've set the constraints now for
目前我已经通过 Document Outline

1666
01:09:33,892 --> 01:09:35,524
that totally using the document outline.
设置好了它的约束

1667
01:09:37,695 --> 01:09:39,194
Now lets do one other thing with the indicator.
再对这个小圆圈做一些其他事情

1668
01:09:39,196 --> 01:09:41,563
I'm going to inspect it over here and
在这里对其属性进行检查

1669
01:09:41,565 --> 01:09:44,866
you can see the indicator has some different styles.
这个小圆圈有不同的风格

1670
01:09:44,868 --> 01:09:45,800
We like grey because we
我们喜欢灰色的

1671
01:09:45,802 --> 01:09:47,534
have a white background so that's good.
因为是白颜色的背景

1672
01:09:47,536 --> 01:09:49,536
But it also has a couple buttons here and
这里也有几个选项

1673
01:09:49,538 --> 01:09:51,971
this is a good one to click, hides when stopped.
hides when stopped 这项不错，可以选中

1674
01:09:52,941 --> 01:09:54,474
That makes it so
这会使得这个小圆圈

1675
01:09:54,475 --> 01:09:56,008
when the spinner stops spinning it hides itself.
在停止旋转的时候，会把自己给隐藏

1676
01:09:57,311 --> 01:09:59,011
So it's only showing while it's spinning,
它只会在旋转的时候才会显示

1677
01:09:59,013 --> 01:10:00,545
which is kind of a nice feature.
这是一个很好地特性

1678
01:10:00,547 --> 01:10:01,979
You can cause it to show and
你可以让它显示或隐藏

1679
01:10:01,981 --> 01:10:04,348
hide yourself, but it's nice to have it hide itself.
但是让它自己隐藏还是很不错的

1680
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:08,885
All right, so we have this nice little spinner here, so
我们已经有了这个不错的小圆圈

1681
01:10:08,887 --> 01:10:10,754
let's go ahead and hook it up into our UI.
把它和我们的代码联系起来

1682
01:10:10,756 --> 01:10:14,257
And I'm just gonna Ctrl+Drag, even control dragging from
按住 Ctrl 拖动

1683
01:10:14,259 --> 01:10:17,093
this can be a bit of a pain, because it's very small and
可能从这里拖动比较困难

1684
01:10:17,095 --> 01:10:18,660
you got all these constraints in the way.
因为它很小，周围还有约束

1685
01:10:18,662 --> 01:10:21,296
So you can actually Ctrl+Drag from over here.
你可以从这里 Ctrl+Drag

1686
01:10:21,298 --> 01:10:25,299
All right so I'll Ctrl+Drag, I'll put it right here.
把它放到这里

1687
01:10:25,301 --> 01:10:26,667
I'm gonna call it spinner.
起名为 spinner

1688
01:10:26,669 --> 01:10:29,370
I like to call my activity indicators spinners but
我喜欢把 Activity Indicator 称为 spinner

1689
01:10:29,372 --> 01:10:32,072
you could call it activity indicator too.
但是你也可以不像我这么叫

1690
01:10:32,074 --> 01:10:35,075
So here's my spinner and
这就是 spinner

1691
01:10:35,077 --> 01:10:36,509
what do I need to do with this spinner?
我应该怎么处理它呢？

1692
01:10:36,511 --> 01:10:38,528
Well, I just need to
我只需要

1693
01:10:38,529 --> 01:10:40,546
start it spinning when I make a request, and then I
在请求的时候让它开始旋转

1694
01:10:40,548 --> 01:10:44,583
need to stop it from spinning when the request is fulfilled.
当请求已经完成的时候让它停止

1695
01:10:44,585 --> 01:10:45,751
Okay?
OK？

1696
01:10:45,752 --> 01:10:46,918
So I'm going to do that.
我会这么做

1697
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,821
And I want to get lots of room here.
我需要一些空间

1698
01:10:49,823 --> 01:10:53,224
So I've got my spinner, well, where do I make a request?
我在哪里做的请求的？

1699
01:10:53,226 --> 01:10:55,426
Let's see, it's right here.
在这里

1700
01:10:55,428 --> 01:10:58,429
Right. This is where I dispatch
这里就是我投递请求的地方

1701
01:10:58,430 --> 01:11:01,431
request so I'm just gonna say spinner, start animating.
在这里，spinner.startAnimating

1702
01:11:01,433 --> 01:11:02,765
But I'm gonna make that even better,
我会处理地更好

1703
01:11:02,767 --> 01:11:04,033
I'm gonna say question mark,
在这里加一个问号

1704
01:11:04,035 --> 01:11:07,236
in case we're fetching an image before our
以防在 Outline 设置好之前

1705
01:11:07,238 --> 01:11:08,604
outlets are loaded.
发出了获取图片的请求

1706
01:11:08,605 --> 01:11:09,971
For some reason, we don't currently do that cause we
我们通常不会这样做

1707
01:11:09,973 --> 01:11:11,673
only do it in view will appear.
只会在 viewWillAppear 里这样处理

1708
01:11:11,675 --> 01:11:13,808
But you know some day someone might write that code.
但是可能某人某天就会写出那样的代码

1709
01:11:14,911 --> 01:11:18,112
And then I could stop the spinner like down in here but
我可以在下面这里让 spinner 停止旋转

1710
01:11:18,114 --> 01:11:20,881
actually a great place to stop the spinner is as soon
实际上让 spinner 停止旋转的很好的地方

1711
01:11:20,883 --> 01:11:22,749
as an image is set.
是在 image 被设置好了的时候

1712
01:11:22,751 --> 01:11:25,351
Anytime an image gets set I don't want to be spinning,
每一次 image 被设置好了以后，我不希望 spinner 旋转

1713
01:11:25,353 --> 01:11:27,553
by definition.
显然

1714
01:11:27,555 --> 01:11:29,989
Right?
好的

1715
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:32,424
So I'm just going to say spinner.stop animating.
spinner.stopAnimating

1716
01:11:32,426 --> 01:11:32,991
Okay?
OK?

1717
01:11:32,993 --> 01:11:35,126
And that's it.
就是这样

1718
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:36,394
That's all it takes to the do the spinner.
处理 spinner 就需要这些工作

1719
01:11:36,396 --> 01:11:38,328
So let's go take a look at the spinner spinning.
让我们看看 spinner 旋转的样子

1720
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:43,400
All right so the spinner didn't spin at
一开始 spinner 并没有旋转

1721
01:11:43,402 --> 01:11:45,335
start because I haven't made any requests.
因为我还没有发出任何请求

1722
01:11:45,337 --> 01:11:48,270
But here if I make a request there's the spinner spinning,
但是如果我做出请求，spinner 就开始旋转了

1723
01:11:48,272 --> 01:11:50,339
and yeah you can make the spinner larger if you want but
你也可以让 spinner 大一些

1724
01:11:50,341 --> 01:11:52,207
it's spinning, it's spinning cuz we're still working on
它一直在旋转，因为它正在处理请求

1725
01:11:52,209 --> 01:11:54,776
it and once the thing appears now my spinner's gone.
一旦我需要的东西出现了，spinner 就消失了

1726
01:11:54,778 --> 01:11:56,944
It's kinda hard to tell in the dark spots but here in
在暗的区域很难看出来

1727
01:11:56,946 --> 01:12:01,048
the light spots you can see that our spinner is gone.
但是在亮的地方你可以看到它消失了

1728
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,383
'Kay same thing we come back, click on this one,
我们回过头再做一次，点击它

1729
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:05,952
spinner comes back, right?
spinner 又出现了

1730
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:07,320
And I can't scroll it.
我不能滚动它

1731
01:12:07,322 --> 01:12:09,955
There's no scrolling or anything like that.
这里还没有 ScrollView

1732
01:12:09,957 --> 01:12:11,957
And then once our thing appears right here,
一旦图片出现

1733
01:12:13,727 --> 01:12:14,392
our spinner is gone.
spinner 就消失了

1734
01:12:19,631 --> 01:12:20,514
Okay?
OK?

1735
01:12:20,515 --> 01:12:21,398
So that's it for today.
这就是今天的内容了

1736
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,265
Questions?
有问题吗？

1737
01:12:22,267 --> 01:12:25,601
What about the self referencing and.
self 引用的问题

1738
01:12:25,603 --> 01:12:27,836
Yeah so let's look at the self referencing thing.
让我们来看看 self 引用的问题

1739
01:12:27,838 --> 01:12:28,804
Did we have a problem with
闭包内部

1740
01:12:28,806 --> 01:12:30,839
self referencing inside this closure.
有 self 引用的问题吗？

1741
01:12:30,841 --> 01:12:32,974
That we did right here, and the answer is no,
答案是，没有问题

1742
01:12:32,976 --> 01:12:36,210
because nowhere inside this closure do we refer to
因为我们没有让闭包内部的任何一个地方

1743
01:12:36,212 --> 01:12:38,579
anything that points to this closure.
指向这个闭包

1744
01:12:38,581 --> 01:12:41,615
Cause this closure just got dispatched a synced,
因为这个闭包刚刚 dispatch_async

1745
01:12:41,617 --> 01:12:43,650
right it got put on some queue somewhere, but
被放入了某个队列之中

1746
01:12:43,652 --> 01:12:45,385
we don't point to it anymore.
但是我们不再指向它了

1747
01:12:45,387 --> 01:12:46,886
The queue points to it basically,
实际上是那个队列指向它

1748
01:12:46,888 --> 01:12:50,022
the queue owns this closure, we self don't.
那个队列拥有它，而我们没有

1749
01:12:50,024 --> 01:12:53,291
So we're okay, we don't have to do any unknown.
所以我们不需要处理，加上 unknown

1750
01:12:53,293 --> 01:12:55,093
But you'll start seeing the unknown thing when we
但是在学习 animation（动画）的时候

1751
01:12:55,095 --> 01:12:56,427
start doing animation.
你就会开始看到 unknown 了

1752
01:12:56,429 --> 01:12:59,864
When we start having actions in the animation that
当我们开始学习动画

1753
01:12:59,866 --> 01:13:03,734
are calling methods inside of our class to do animation, so
在 action 中调用类中的方法的时候

1754
01:13:03,736 --> 01:13:08,471
you'll see that there.
