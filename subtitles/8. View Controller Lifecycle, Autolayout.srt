2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:08,072
Stanford University.

3
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:11,275
Okay, well, welcome to Lecture 8 of

4
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:14,812
Stanford CS193P winter of 2015.

5
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:18,348
Today we have two major topics we're gonna talk about,

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,584
one is view controller life cycle which is your view

7
00:00:21,586 --> 00:00:23,119
controller gets born.

8
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:25,021
It lives and does a lot of things and

9
00:00:25,023 --> 00:00:27,856
then it dies and so you want to be able to find out about

10
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:30,392
all those things that are going on and you can.

11
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:32,627
I'm gonna have a brief demo about that and

12
00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:34,762
then we're gonna go into auto layout and

13
00:00:34,764 --> 00:00:37,331
I keep promising we're gonna talk about it, so

14
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,967
I am gonna finally talk about auto layout.

15
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:42,002
Of course you all ready know a lot about auto layout and

16
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:43,987
I'm gonna review that.

17
00:00:43,988 --> 00:00:45,971
Then we're gonna talk about an important piece of auto

18
00:00:45,974 --> 00:00:50,343
layout that we haven't talked so far which is size classes,

19
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:53,078
and then I'll be doing a humongous couple of

20
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,181
demos on auto lab because, you know, it's the kind of thing

21
00:00:56,183 --> 00:00:59,918
you're going to have to see it to really understand it, but

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,453
first, let's talk about view controller life cycle.

23
00:01:03,723 --> 00:01:06,090
When we refer to the view controller life cycle,

24
00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:07,691
we're just talking about a sequence of

25
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:11,261
messages that is sent to your view controller as it

26
00:01:11,263 --> 00:01:12,929
progresses through its lifetime.

27
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:16,231
Why do we care about this?

28
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:18,967
Well because you very commonly wanna override these

29
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:20,935
messages that are sent to the view controller in

30
00:01:20,937 --> 00:01:23,871
your subclass to find out what's going on, because you

31
00:01:23,873 --> 00:01:26,140
might need to do things, make certain decisions or

32
00:01:26,142 --> 00:01:29,343
whatever at certain points in your view controller life

33
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:32,846
cycle, so let's talk about the cycle and how it goes.

34
00:01:32,848 --> 00:01:34,881
It starts off with creation.

35
00:01:34,883 --> 00:01:39,352
99% of the time, this is from a storyboard, all right.

36
00:01:39,354 --> 00:01:41,987
As you know, you create these scenes in the storyboard.

37
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:44,856
Those scenes have a view controller class associated

38
00:01:44,858 --> 00:01:48,493
with them and you're just, you're segueing to an MVC,

39
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:52,897
even if you create an MVC in code, which I don't even talk

40
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:54,732
about how to do, maybe we'll talk about it a little later

41
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:56,433
in the quarter, but could look up in the documentation,

42
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:58,218
it's quite easy.

43
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,002
Even in that case, you're going to instantiate a view

44
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:03,006
controller using identifier in the storyboard, okay, and

45
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:04,707
that's how you're gonna get the view controller,

46
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:07,643
so creation is all most always from the storyboard, and

47
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:10,479
there is an init that gets called, it's kind of a weird

48
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:12,847
init, initWithCoder, I'm not gonna talk about it too much,

49
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:15,283
I mentioned it a little bit in the reading assignment,

50
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:16,784
number one or number two.

51
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:20,654
I don't remember, so there is an init but we try to stay

52
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:23,223
away from init so if we can, if they're somewhere else, and

53
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:25,492
in the view control life cycle there's a lot of

54
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:28,995
somewhere else's to initialize things besides in init, so

55
00:02:28,997 --> 00:02:32,698
I'm not even gonna talk about the init right here.

56
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,100
Okay, what happens after that initialization though?

57
00:02:35,102 --> 00:02:36,468
Well, the first thing is,

58
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,638
you get prepared if you're being segued to, all right,

59
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,575
the next thing is your outlets are gonna get set, 'kay.

60
00:02:44,577 --> 00:02:47,444
It's just we're gonna wire up all those at sign IV outlets

61
00:02:47,446 --> 00:02:50,747
that you have, and then your view controller's gonna

62
00:02:50,749 --> 00:02:53,316
appear on screen and then it might disappear and

63
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:56,486
then might reappear and then disappear, okay, and

64
00:02:56,488 --> 00:02:59,155
its geometry might change because of auto rotation or

65
00:02:59,157 --> 00:03:02,991
something else happens and changes the geometry review,

66
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:04,292
so that's happening.

67
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:06,494
And then in obscure cases,

68
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:09,296
you might have a low memory situation on your device and

69
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:13,367
the system might try to get you involved to resolve that,

70
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:15,402
and we'll talk about that briefly, all right, so

71
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,104
that's the cycle.

72
00:03:17,105 --> 00:03:18,805
So what are these methods that are involved in that cycle?

73
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:22,408
Well you know about the preparation that's prepared

74
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,044
for segue and some other MVC that's what prepares you,

75
00:03:25,046 --> 00:03:28,047
and you know about outlet setting, right, just

76
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:30,549
system automatically sets your outlook from your storyboard.

77
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:32,550
So the next thing that happens is loading,

78
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:35,720
as your view gets load, well we call that outlet setting,

79
00:03:35,722 --> 00:03:39,023
the loading process, and when it's done loading it sends you

80
00:03:39,025 --> 00:03:40,924
this message viewDidLoad.

81
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:43,760
ViewDidLoad is an exceptionally good place to

82
00:03:43,762 --> 00:03:47,297
put stuff to initialize your view, why is it so good?

83
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:51,634
Because you're prepared by whoever's segueing to you, and

84
00:03:51,636 --> 00:03:54,970
your outlets are all set, 'kay, so you're in

85
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:57,706
great shape to go do things to initialize your view,

86
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,343
cuz you are all kinda set up and ready to go.

87
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:03,644
Now, when you override viewDidLoad, it's important to

88
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:06,147
call super.viewDidLoad and in fact in

89
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:09,249
all these life cycle methods you always wanna call super.

90
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:10,817
You can either call it at the beginning or at the end,

91
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,586
kind of up to you, doesn't really matter usually but

92
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:16,289
you definitely want to let super have a chance to do it,

93
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,457
'kay, so don't forget about that.

94
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,095
Now one thing that you often wanna do in vewDidLoad is

95
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,729
update your UI, okay?

96
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,765
Now you're gonna be updating your UI in the property

97
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,035
observers of all your things that change the model, and

98
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,804
you should continue to do that because your view

99
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,440
control might be on screen all ready loaded,

100
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,576
someone changes the model, you gotta update the UI.

101
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:42,178
But when you're first having your thing created and

102
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,313
you want to update your UI, it's kind of,

103
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:47,149
you know, your property observer's in your model, and

104
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:50,152
aren't really updating the UI because your outlets aren't

105
00:04:50,154 --> 00:04:52,354
set maybe because you're in the prepare for

106
00:04:52,356 --> 00:04:53,688
segue phase right?

107
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,956
So a lot of times, you get to viewDidLoad and

108
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,059
you haven't really been able to update your UI because your

109
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:00,660
outlets haven't been set, so

110
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:03,430
viewDidLoad is a great place to then update your UI.

111
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:07,033
So if you factor out updating UI into a separate method like

112
00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:09,502
we did in the demo called update UI, but

113
00:05:09,504 --> 00:05:11,637
you can call whatever you want, or

114
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,273
you can even have a couple different UI updating methods,

115
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:18,677
calling those in viewDidLoad is very common, 'kay,

116
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:22,313
cuz your view is ready to be updated, however, you have to

117
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:26,183
be careful here because your geometry is not yet set, 'kay?

118
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:27,517
You only get loaded once,

119
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,753
when you first come out of the storyboard and

120
00:05:29,755 --> 00:05:31,921
you get prepared, your outlets gets set,

121
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:33,756
you get viewDidLoad, that's it.

122
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:37,059
That only happens once in the lifetime of a view controller,

123
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:39,661
but your geometry, like what your bounds are,

124
00:05:39,663 --> 00:05:41,096
that has not been set yet,

125
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:44,332
that's not gonna be set till later in its lifetime, okay?

126
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:47,702
So do not do, I should have put this in red, do not put,

127
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:51,005
do geometry related things in viewDidLoad, 'kay,

128
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:54,374
you can do almost everything else in viewDidLoad, but

129
00:05:54,376 --> 00:05:57,877
do not do that, 'kay, and we'll talk about where you do

130
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:01,180
do those things in a moment here, all right.

131
00:06:01,182 --> 00:06:04,517
Next one in the life cycle is viewWillAppear,

132
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:07,386
'kay, so that's sent to you right before you're going to

133
00:06:07,388 --> 00:06:08,854
appear on screen.

134
00:06:08,856 --> 00:06:10,889
Now, that could be right after viewDidLoad or

135
00:06:10,891 --> 00:06:12,623
it could be a long time after viewDidLoad.

136
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,192
It depends on what's going on in your UI,

137
00:06:15,194 --> 00:06:17,995
okay, and viewWillAppear gets an argument, which is

138
00:06:17,997 --> 00:06:20,831
whether it's an animated appearance or not, 'kay?

139
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,966
Usually you don't care about that.

140
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:24,734
And when would your appearance be animated?

141
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:27,069
Well you're in a navigation controller and

142
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,471
someone presses to segue you on screen,

143
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,207
you'll slide in, that's the animation, okay?

144
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:35,743
So, viewWillAppear,

145
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:38,812
this could happen all the time, this could happen

146
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:40,981
repeatedly in the lifetime of your view controller,

147
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,416
cuz your view controller can come on screen or go off.

148
00:06:43,418 --> 00:06:45,651
Let's think of an example, split view,

149
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:47,586
the master of a split view.

150
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:50,522
When you first bring up your iPad user interface,

151
00:06:50,524 --> 00:06:52,524
it's in portrait, you don't see the master,

152
00:06:52,526 --> 00:06:54,659
you have to kind of slide it out to see the master,

153
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:57,462
you only see the detail, right, so it's not visible.

154
00:06:57,464 --> 00:07:00,564
You rotate to landscape, now the master becomes visible, so

155
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:02,066
you're gonna get viewWillAppear.

156
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:05,902
You rotate back to portrait, it's off screen.

157
00:07:05,904 --> 00:07:07,904
You rotate back to landscape, it's gonna appear again,

158
00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:09,706
it's gonna send you viewWillAppear again.

159
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,475
So you're gonna get viewWillAppear every time it

160
00:07:12,477 --> 00:07:14,477
appears on screen,

161
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:16,478
'kay, now what would you do when a viewWillAppear?

162
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,014
A lot of times maybe, if you have to do something very

163
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:21,282
expensive, like let's say you have to go out to the network

164
00:07:21,284 --> 00:07:24,118
to get something, an image or something like that,

165
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,121
you might not want to do that in viewDidLoad because maybe

166
00:07:27,123 --> 00:07:30,057
the user never turns view to landscape and never looks at

167
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:32,426
your master, maybe you've got an app where the details all

168
00:07:32,428 --> 00:07:34,894
are that matters and people rarely pull out the master.

169
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:36,646
Well, you wouldn't wanna do

170
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:38,397
that expensive thing until the master actually appeared.

171
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,633
Now, you're gonna wanna do that expensive thing in

172
00:07:40,635 --> 00:07:42,401
another thread, we'll talk about it on

173
00:07:42,403 --> 00:07:44,236
Wednesday to keep the main thread active.

174
00:07:44,238 --> 00:07:46,438
And, of course, when that master appeared, if

175
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,140
you're waiting for something on the network there's gonna

176
00:07:49,142 --> 00:07:51,642
be a blank space or something that we'll fill in later,

177
00:07:51,644 --> 00:07:54,078
maybe you put a spinning wheel, things like that, but

178
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,780
viewWillAppear since you know you're actually gonna get on

179
00:07:56,782 --> 00:07:59,149
screen is a place we might kick off something that's

180
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:01,718
a little bit expensive, also your geometry is set here.

181
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,987
Okay, by the time you get view will appear your bounds,

182
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:08,424
your view's bounds, you're a view controller right, so

183
00:08:08,426 --> 00:08:11,059
your view's bound, view.bound is set, so

184
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:13,061
you can do geometry stuff here.

185
00:08:13,063 --> 00:08:16,597
It's legal and you might want to, 'kay, but

186
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:19,266
I'm gonna show you another place you can do that as well

187
00:08:19,268 --> 00:08:21,335
on the next couple slides.

188
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:24,804
There's also a viewDidAppear in addition to viewWillAppear,

189
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:26,072
'kay, so

190
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:29,208
viewDidAppear gets sent to you after you are now on screen.

191
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,912
You are visible now, 'kay, pretty straightforward, and

192
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,681
similarly there's viewWillDisappear, so

193
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,416
you're just about to be taken off screen.

194
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:41,352
Again, you're the split view master in landscape,

195
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,320
the person rotates the portrait, you're gonna

196
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,790
get viewWillDisappear cuz you're going to disappear,

197
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:50,794
it's just going to show only the detail, 'kay?

198
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:54,864
Here you might clean up some stuff, you might get rid of

199
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:57,867
some resources that are expensive, like a big image or

200
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:00,135
something that you can reconstitute fairly quickly,

201
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:02,170
maybe from disk or something.

202
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:03,605
That's the kind of thing you'll do in

203
00:09:03,606 --> 00:09:05,039
viewWillDisappear, and of course, there's a did version

204
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:11,178
of this too, viewDidDisappear, 'kay, so that will disappear,

205
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,048
will appear and will disappear in their dids, okay?

206
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,317
Now let's talk about geometry.

207
00:09:16,318 --> 00:09:18,585
So when your geometry changes, when your bounds change,

208
00:09:18,587 --> 00:09:21,521
the system knows that your bounds changed, and

209
00:09:21,523 --> 00:09:24,891
it knows that you probably have to re-layout your user

210
00:09:24,893 --> 00:09:26,158
interface, okay?

211
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,728
Now 99% of the time, that's gonna happen by magic because

212
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,798
you've set up your auto layout properly, right, so

213
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,467
you don't even have to do anything, but if for

214
00:09:35,469 --> 00:09:37,802
some reason you wanted to do something,

215
00:09:37,804 --> 00:09:40,271
you can override one of these two methods,

216
00:09:40,273 --> 00:09:43,574
viewWillLayoutSubviews and viewDidLayoutSubviews,

217
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:46,643
so the system calls viewWillLayoutSubviews anytime

218
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:48,445
it wants to,

219
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:50,246
make sure that your views are properly laid out.

220
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:54,550
Now, when it calls, this is not viewsBoundsDidChange,

221
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,818
that's not the name of this method,

222
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,620
okay, it's a viewWillLayoutSubviews, so

223
00:09:58,622 --> 00:10:01,523
your subviews can get laid out for lots of different reasons,

224
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:04,325
maybe one of your subviews changes in a way that causes

225
00:10:04,327 --> 00:10:07,762
it to change shape and has to be relaid out, et cetera.

226
00:10:07,764 --> 00:10:10,497
So, viewWillLayoutSubviews is sent to

227
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:13,400
you when someone inside your

228
00:10:13,402 --> 00:10:17,037
view hierarchy or your top level bounds change in a way

229
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,840
where the system needs you to layout your subviews, okay?

230
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:23,576
Now, you can make this happen by calling, just like you

231
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:26,478
have set needs display you can say set needs layout.

232
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,715
You say set needs layout, then the next pass around the event

233
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:35,286
loop, the system will re-layout your subviews, 'kay.

234
00:10:35,288 --> 00:10:38,288
Now this can be called, quite often this viewWill and

235
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:42,092
DidLayoutSubviews because changes are being made all

236
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:44,061
the time and the system doesn't

237
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:46,029
always quite know whether that affected your subview, so

238
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:48,898
it might ask you to just lay them out again, okay?

239
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,101
So don't be surprised when you get viewWillLayoutSubviews two

240
00:10:52,103 --> 00:10:55,203
or three times when the bounds only changed once, let's say,

241
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:56,438
'kay, and you have to,

242
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,040
if you're gonna do something in these two methods,

243
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:01,108
you're gonna have to do the right thing,

244
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,711
even if like your bounds don't actually change.

245
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:07,447
This whole process of laying out your subviews,

246
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:10,717
the idea is to make sure that your subviews

247
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,185
are properly laid out.

248
00:11:13,187 --> 00:11:16,655
Now again, most of that's happening with auto layout,

249
00:11:16,657 --> 00:11:19,958
and the auto layout happens between these two methods, so

250
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,361
you get view a layout subviews, you do whatever you

251
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:26,264
wanna do, then auto layout happens, then you get

252
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:29,200
viewDidLayoutSubviews, 'kay, so your subviews might have

253
00:11:29,202 --> 00:11:33,136
moved around between the two calls of these, make sense?

254
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:34,170
Any questions about that?

255
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:39,008
So, yeah, these things might be called quite a lot and

256
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,510
we'll see that in the demo that they might get called,

257
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:43,462
and called, and called.

258
00:11:43,463 --> 00:11:45,413
Autorotation, really you wanna think of

259
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:49,718
autorotation primarily as just your bounds changed, so

260
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,720
autorotation is really a non-event.

261
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:55,856
As we have seen in all of our apps we have been writing so

262
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:58,092
far, we don't even think about autorotation,

263
00:11:58,094 --> 00:12:00,961
it just happens our bounds change, auto layout works and

264
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:03,380
the world is good.

265
00:12:03,381 --> 00:12:05,798
And that's the way you should think of it 99% of the time,

266
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,833
but if for some reason,

267
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:11,203
you care about the actual case where rotation is happening,

268
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:13,905
in other words, your device got turned and

269
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:16,775
so the bounds got to be wider than tall and when they used

270
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:20,345
to be taller than wide, then you can participate.

271
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:23,848
By the way, first line there says you can go to

272
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,449
your project settings and

273
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:27,918
prevent certain autorotation from happening,

274
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,787
and the default by the way is that portrait upside down

275
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:31,854
is prevented.

276
00:12:31,856 --> 00:12:33,856
That's why you noticed your app,

277
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:36,425
you go in the simulator and you rotate it to landscape and

278
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:38,493
then you rotate it again to upside down and

279
00:12:38,495 --> 00:12:40,128
it doesn't autorotate,

280
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,063
that's because in your private setting you said, oh,

281
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:45,199
portrait upside down is not a supported orientation.

282
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:46,767
So when you go to portrait upside down,

283
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:49,603
it just does not autorotate, and you can flip those four

284
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:52,572
switches for the landscapes and portraits any way you

285
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:56,376
want, okay, it depends on your UI and what makes sense.

286
00:12:56,378 --> 00:12:59,145
Some UIs make no sense in landscape, some only make

287
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:00,713
sense in landscape, there might be a game or

288
00:13:00,715 --> 00:13:04,449
something that just doesn't make sense in portrait, 'kay?

289
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,384
So, but if you want to participate in the

290
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,821
autorotation, 'kay, like you want to do some animation of

291
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,656
your own, because you notice that the rotation is animated,

292
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:16,026
right it goes from portrait to landscape, it kinda moves the

293
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,495
views around, it's hard to see cause it's happening so fast,

294
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:21,197
but it is animating it, and you can actually participate

295
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:24,934
that by this method viewWillTransitionToSize,

296
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:28,904
which is part of the life cycle.

297
00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:30,772
And this transition coordinator you get,

298
00:13:30,774 --> 00:13:32,340
now I'm not gonna talk about how to implement this,

299
00:13:32,342 --> 00:13:33,708
I haven't even talked about animation,

300
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,343
we're not gonna talk about that for a couple of weeks,

301
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:39,479
but there is a method in that coordinator, for example,

302
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:43,649
called animate alongside, and you can specify what kinda

303
00:13:43,651 --> 00:13:46,452
animations you want to animate alongside the rotation.

304
00:13:46,454 --> 00:13:48,253
So I'm just telling you this now because it's part of

305
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:50,422
the view controller life cycle and

306
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:53,291
you should just know in your head that it exists.

307
00:13:53,293 --> 00:13:55,460
Okay, it's a little bit of a complicated thing to use,

308
00:13:55,462 --> 00:13:59,563
because when you rotate and you change bounds, really it's

309
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:02,433
container views that are most concerned with that, like

310
00:14:02,435 --> 00:14:05,502
a split view, it needs to now put both things on screen and

311
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:08,838
put a line and when you switch the other way.

312
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,175
It's really about container views, a little less than

313
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:15,277
about leaf view controllers, but leaf view controller might

314
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,180
wanna know what's going on, all right, and

315
00:14:18,182 --> 00:14:21,049
then low memory, you get this didReceiveMemoryWarning.

316
00:14:21,051 --> 00:14:22,684
Here you wanna throw away anything in

317
00:14:22,686 --> 00:14:25,186
the heap that's easy to reconstitute.

318
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:28,689
The way you throw things out of the heap, by the way,

319
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:34,094
is you just set all pointers that you have to them to nil,

320
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:36,329
okay, if you're not pointing to something,

321
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:38,664
then it won't stay in the heap, it gets thrown out.

322
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,299
That does not include weak pointers.

323
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:41,667
If you have a weak pointer to something,

324
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:43,435
it still gets thrown out, 'kay?

325
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:46,337
If the only pointer in the world to an image in the heap

326
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:48,205
is a weak pointer, it's gonna get pitched, and

327
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:50,040
that weak pointer's gonna get set to nil,

328
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:52,976
'kay, as we talked about when we talked about delegation,

329
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:57,580
'kay, that's the definition of a weak pointer, okay?

330
00:14:57,582 --> 00:15:00,449
So, in low memory situations, you know, try to clean up.

331
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:01,550
You'll all most never get this,

332
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:02,617
you may never, ever get this.

333
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:05,153
If your app is very highly image intensive,

334
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,621
maybe it's an image processing app and

335
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:09,757
you've got a lot of images in there, then it's possible,

336
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,192
I suppose, but it's extremely unlikely,

337
00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:14,361
'kay, there's a lot of memory in these devices.

338
00:15:15,964 --> 00:15:19,032
Okay, now I'm gonna go back to awakeFromNib, which is not

339
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:21,133
really part of the view controller life cycle,

340
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:23,018
but a view controller,

341
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:24,902
just like any other NS object subclass that comes out of

342
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:27,873
a storyboard, will get awakeFromNib.

343
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,775
And there are some students, as a class in the past,

344
00:15:30,777 --> 00:15:32,877
that have kind of abused awakeFromNib and they just

345
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,579
start trying to put everything in their initialization into

346
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:38,215
awakeFromNib instead of putting it into viewDidLoad or

347
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:41,585
viewWillAppear, or viewWillLayoutSubviews,

348
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:44,421
depending on what kind of thing it is.

349
00:15:44,423 --> 00:15:47,423
And I'm just warning you here, don't abuse awakeFromNib, but

350
00:15:47,425 --> 00:15:50,026
there are some cases where awakeFromNib is necessary.

351
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:52,561
For example, if you want to set yourself as the delegate

352
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:55,163
of the split view controller you're in, awayFromNib is

353
00:15:55,165 --> 00:15:57,632
a good place to do that, because then it happens really

354
00:15:57,634 --> 00:16:00,401
early and you'll start getting those delegate methods from

355
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:02,937
split view as you go through the rest of your life cycle.

356
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:05,139
Okay?

357
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,340
So there are some times when awakeFromNib is good.

358
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:10,010
All right, so here's the summary of the life cycle.

359
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,911
You get instantiated, usually from the storyboard.

360
00:16:11,913 --> 00:16:14,180
You're gonna get awakeFromNib.

361
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,015
Segue prep is gonna happen.

362
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,317
Your outlets are gonna get set by the system.

363
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:20,252
ViewDidLoad is gonna get called.

364
00:16:20,254 --> 00:16:21,720
View will appear and disappear.

365
00:16:21,722 --> 00:16:24,589
It's gonna happen as your controller goes on and

366
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:26,708
off screen.

367
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:28,826
And as your view controller's geometry changes or

368
00:16:28,828 --> 00:16:31,462
the subviews change in a way that needs to be re-laid out,

369
00:16:31,464 --> 00:16:33,063
you're gonna get WillLayoutSubviews,

370
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:34,931
then autolayout, then DidLayoutSubviews.

371
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:37,233
So that could happen many times.

372
00:16:37,235 --> 00:16:38,401
And if you get low on memory,

373
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:40,302
you could have this memory warning, okay?

374
00:16:40,304 --> 00:16:42,537
So that's the View Controller Lifecycle.

375
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:44,906
There is actually one other one in here.

376
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:48,810
It'll tell you when your size class changes.

377
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:50,845
But I haven't talked about size class yet, so

378
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:52,112
I didn't put that in this list.

379
00:16:52,114 --> 00:16:53,413
But there's one more, and

380
00:16:53,415 --> 00:16:57,017
there will transition to traits or something like that.

381
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:01,153
All right, so I'm gonna do a quick demo here, super fast.

382
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:06,991
Let me get something to drink here, okay?

383
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,826
So I'm gonna do a quick demo.

384
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:11,595
And all I did is I took Psychologist from last time,

385
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,497
and I just put a bunch of printlns in all

386
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,832
these View Controler Lifecycle methods, okay?

387
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:19,069
So that it would just print out where it is in

388
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,937
Lifecycle all the time.

389
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,204
So, let's go do that.

390
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:22,971
Let's go run that.

391
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:28,976
It is here in Developer, Psychologist Lecture 8.

392
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:30,378
Here we go.

393
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,713
So you can see that in viewWillAppear() I

394
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:35,749
put a little log for that, disappear, all these.

395
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:38,185
So I'm just making it basically

396
00:17:38,186 --> 00:17:40,620
logging all the things that are happening, okay.

397
00:17:40,622 --> 00:17:42,689
So lets go, I'm gonna run this on iPad.

398
00:17:44,058 --> 00:17:46,158
It's a little easier to make things happen here.

399
00:17:48,695 --> 00:17:50,561
All right, so here's our Psychologist.

400
00:17:50,563 --> 00:17:52,096
I haven't changed anything about the app.

401
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:55,232
I'm gonna make the console really big so

402
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:58,135
that we can see what's going on here.

403
00:17:58,137 --> 00:17:59,969
All right, so notice we came up.

404
00:17:59,971 --> 00:18:01,337
The detail is the only thing,

405
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:03,105
the detail is Happiness View Controller.

406
00:18:03,107 --> 00:18:04,606
It's the only thing visible.

407
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:06,341
So what happened here?

408
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:08,075
The Psychologist got pulled out of the storyboard.

409
00:18:08,078 --> 00:18:10,311
The Happiness got pulled out of the storyboard.

410
00:18:10,313 --> 00:18:12,380
This zero is which instance of it.

411
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,116
Cuz we're gonna have multiple instances, eventually.

412
00:18:15,118 --> 00:18:16,517
Then Happiness got awakeFromNib.

413
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:18,085
Then Psychologist got awakeFromNib.

414
00:18:18,087 --> 00:18:21,154
The order of awakeFromNib is completely not determinable,

415
00:18:21,156 --> 00:18:22,321
so you should not depend on it.

416
00:18:23,324 --> 00:18:25,524
Then the master got viewDidLoad.

417
00:18:25,526 --> 00:18:27,459
Even though the master never appears on screen,

418
00:18:27,461 --> 00:18:29,461
it still had its outlet set, and

419
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:31,362
got viewDidLoad sent to it.

420
00:18:31,364 --> 00:18:35,499
Then interestingly, the master was asked to lay itself out,

421
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:37,167
to lay its Subviews out.

422
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:38,601
Okay again, it hasn't appeared.

423
00:18:38,603 --> 00:18:40,203
It hasn't even gotten viewWillAppear,

424
00:18:40,205 --> 00:18:41,537
because it's not gonna appear.

425
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:46,942
But its Subviews wanna get laid out.

426
00:18:46,944 --> 00:18:47,942
And why is this happen?

427
00:18:47,944 --> 00:18:49,377
Well, you know, the system might be

428
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,513
preparing to animate it onscreen or something.

429
00:18:52,515 --> 00:18:53,313
You just want to make sure.

430
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:54,815
This is not doing any drawing.

431
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:56,400
This is just making sure

432
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,984
the Subviews are properly laid out.

433
00:18:57,986 --> 00:19:02,321
It happens twice here, maybe a before and after animation.

434
00:19:02,323 --> 00:19:03,489
Who knows what's going on here,

435
00:19:03,491 --> 00:19:05,023
it doesn't really matter.

436
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:07,859
The size didn't actually change.

437
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:09,260
Okay, the bound size didn't actually change, so

438
00:19:09,262 --> 00:19:11,595
this second one probably did almost nothing here.

439
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:15,832
Then the detail, Happiness, it gets a videwDidLoad and then

440
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:18,501
it gets a viewWillAppear, cuz it's gonna appear onscreen.

441
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:21,204
The animated is false because it doesn't animate on screen.

442
00:19:21,206 --> 00:19:23,172
It was the initial thing that shows up in screen, so

443
00:19:23,174 --> 00:19:24,473
boom, it just pops up there.

444
00:19:25,442 --> 00:19:28,343
It gets laid out and then it gets viewDidAppear.

445
00:19:28,345 --> 00:19:30,445
And here it is, okay?

446
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:31,779
Everyone understand that?

447
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:34,381
Now I'm going to rotate to landscape, and

448
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:36,049
that's gonna cause the master to appear.

449
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,450
So watch this.

450
00:19:37,452 --> 00:19:39,803
So we do rotate,

451
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,155
all these dash, that's what happened since I rotated here.

452
00:19:42,157 --> 00:19:45,224
And you can see Psychologist and Happiness both got

453
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,460
informed that this transition to size is going to happen.

454
00:19:48,462 --> 00:19:50,045
So they could have

455
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:51,629
participated in the animation if they want, and you're gonna

456
00:19:51,632 --> 00:19:54,199
see the animation happen in a little bit down the road here.

457
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:58,069
The master got another chance to lay its Subviews out in

458
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,269
a little different size.

459
00:19:59,271 --> 00:20:02,706
Because this size, it's only 768 high instead of

460
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:06,242
the full 1024, and it's a little wider too.

461
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:09,078
So it got laid out, then it got viewWillAppear.

462
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,715
So this guy was told it would appear, okay?

463
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:15,517
And this guy didn't get any viewWillAppear because it's

464
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:17,369
already there.

465
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,220
So it's not appearing, it was already there before.

466
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:22,291
So it gets viewWillAppear.

467
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:25,360
Now the detail gets chance to lay its Subviews out here at

468
00:20:25,362 --> 00:20:27,262
a new size.

469
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,163
Because it used to be the whole screen,

470
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:31,064
now it's just this part right here, so it got a new layout.

471
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:33,567
And then the master was asked to layout its Subviews again.

472
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:35,635
So you see how I'm saying this gets called a lot.

473
00:20:35,637 --> 00:20:37,504
So you just need to

474
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:39,372
make sure that if you're doing anything in these two methods,

475
00:20:39,374 --> 00:20:41,674
that it's okay to be doing it over and over.

476
00:20:41,676 --> 00:20:44,343
Here's where the actually animation happens.

477
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:46,945
And you can see that both the Psychologist and the Happiness

478
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:49,548
have been invited to animate alongside if they wanted to.

479
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:53,718
Then the master is asked to layout one more time,

480
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,653
same size.

481
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,587
That's the third time its been asked to do that.

482
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:02,092
And then the master gets viewDataAppear, okay?

483
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,728
Now the last thing I'm gonna do is click one of these,

484
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,330
which is gonna cause a segue which is gonna cause this to

485
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,564
be replaced.

486
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:10,232
So let's do that.

487
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:11,899
So we'll try the dancing tree here.

488
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:12,601
Okay?

489
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:13,802
So what happened here?

490
00:21:13,804 --> 00:21:14,802
A new Happiness.

491
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:18,839
Happiness 1 got instantiated here, okay?

492
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:21,508
We have Happiness 0 up here and Happiness 1.

493
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,645
It got prepared with Happiness of a hundred.

494
00:21:25,647 --> 00:21:27,180
Okay?

495
00:21:27,181 --> 00:21:28,714
Then layout Subviews of the master again.

496
00:21:28,716 --> 00:21:33,952
Then the Happiness 0 got viewWillDisappear.

497
00:21:33,954 --> 00:21:35,387
Happiness 0, that old Happiness of

498
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:37,105
course getting pulled out and

499
00:21:37,106 --> 00:21:38,822
replaced by the new one, so it got viewWillDisappear.

500
00:21:38,825 --> 00:21:41,525
Then the master got laid out again, and

501
00:21:41,527 --> 00:21:44,395
then viewDidLoad happened on Happiness 1,

502
00:21:44,397 --> 00:21:46,596
the new happiness that's appearing.

503
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:49,799
Then it got viewWillAppear cuz it's going to appear.

504
00:21:49,801 --> 00:21:51,768
Then it got a chance to be laid out.

505
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,236
The old Happiness disappeared.

506
00:21:54,238 --> 00:21:56,972
The new Happiness appeared and then the old

507
00:21:56,974 --> 00:21:59,274
Happiness got deinitialized, thrown out of the heap.

508
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,476
Because like I said, once you segue away from it,

509
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,312
boom, it's gone.

510
00:22:04,313 --> 00:22:05,045
Okay? So that's all I

511
00:22:05,048 --> 00:22:06,413
wanted to cover there.

512
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:08,348
Everybody cool with that?

513
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:10,282
Any questions about that View Controller Lifecycle?

514
00:22:12,387 --> 00:22:14,086
It's pretty straightforward, but you can already probably

515
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:15,821
imagine in your head some things that you were

516
00:22:15,823 --> 00:22:18,790
doing in your code that's like oh, I wish I had viewDidLoad.

517
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:20,158
That really could have

518
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,893
initialized some stuff there a little simpler.

519
00:22:21,895 --> 00:22:24,562
All right, so let's go back to our slides.

520
00:22:25,865 --> 00:22:29,232
All right, so you've seen a lot of Autolayout already in

521
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:31,017
this class, so

522
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,801
I'm gonna review briefly the things you should know.

523
00:22:32,804 --> 00:22:35,204
One is you know about using the dashed lines.

524
00:22:36,374 --> 00:22:40,175
Using the blue dashed lines is helping the interface builder.

525
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:41,810
By the way, when I refer to interface builder,

526
00:22:41,812 --> 00:22:44,579
that means Xcode, the storyboard part of Xcode.

527
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:46,781
We call that interface builder for historical reasons.

528
00:22:48,184 --> 00:22:50,984
So, when you're in the storyboard of Xcode,

529
00:22:50,986 --> 00:22:54,388
the dashed lines are kind of telling Xcode what you want,

530
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,889
what you intend.

531
00:22:55,891 --> 00:22:57,824
As best that you can, okay?

532
00:22:57,826 --> 00:23:01,227
Then you know about Ctrl-dragging between views to

533
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:03,095
create relationships, right?

534
00:23:03,097 --> 00:23:05,864
Like spacing, and hook this to the left edge, and

535
00:23:05,866 --> 00:23:06,898
stuff like that.

536
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,467
You know about those in the lower right corner,

537
00:23:09,469 --> 00:23:12,603
the "Pin" and "Arranged" popovers down there that let

538
00:23:12,605 --> 00:23:15,839
you do things like set all the things to equal widths, or

539
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:17,507
create spacing between all of them, or

540
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:19,776
line up their left edges, okay?

541
00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:23,346
You know about using Reset to Suggested Constraints.

542
00:23:23,348 --> 00:23:24,747
If you use the blue lines,

543
00:23:24,749 --> 00:23:27,583
sometimes you'll do Reset to Suggested Constraints, and

544
00:23:27,585 --> 00:23:29,584
it will actually figure out what you want.

545
00:23:29,586 --> 00:23:30,819
I'd say only 50 percent of the time,

546
00:23:30,821 --> 00:23:32,420
but it's worth a try sometimes.

547
00:23:34,557 --> 00:23:35,722
The Document Outline,

548
00:23:35,724 --> 00:23:37,724
you know that on the left in the document outline,

549
00:23:37,726 --> 00:23:39,726
all your constraints are listed there.

550
00:23:39,728 --> 00:23:41,093
Okay. And also that's where,

551
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:44,029
if you've got problems, you can click on the little red or

552
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:45,797
yellow button in the upper right-hand corner of

553
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,499
the Document Outline and it'll tell you.

554
00:23:47,501 --> 00:23:51,836
It might even suggest some ways to fix things, possibly.

555
00:23:51,838 --> 00:23:53,704
And certainly will tell you if anything's misplaced.

556
00:23:53,706 --> 00:23:56,807
And you know from there, you can also fix your misplaced

557
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:59,743
views by clicking on the little triangles in there.

558
00:23:59,745 --> 00:24:01,577
You know about the size inspector.

559
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:03,579
If you inspect a view in your storyboard and

560
00:24:03,581 --> 00:24:05,080
you look at the size inspector,

561
00:24:05,082 --> 00:24:07,282
you'll see all the constraints listed there.

562
00:24:07,284 --> 00:24:10,818
In there, all the constraints are shown with their details.

563
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,104
Okay?

564
00:24:13,105 --> 00:24:15,389
What the constants are, all that stuff, is listed there.

565
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:19,859
And of course you can edit the constraints there.

566
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:22,929
You can also, you know that you can click on a constraint.

567
00:24:22,931 --> 00:24:24,363
And bring up the attributes inspector.

568
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:27,232
And now you can inspect the constraint directly, okay?

569
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:29,234
It will be the thing that's selected so the attributes

570
00:24:29,236 --> 00:24:31,936
inspector will let you set its attributes, okay?

571
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:34,906
So you know a lot here about autolayout.

572
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:37,041
And that is basically what autolayout is.

573
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:38,409
It's those things.

574
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:40,877
Okay, now again, as I've said many times,

575
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,079
mastering autolayout requires experience.

576
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,715
You gotta know how to use all these tools,

577
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,450
to greatest effect, okay.

578
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,818
You gotta familiarize yourself with what things can I

579
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,355
align to things, what things can I pin to here and there,

580
00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:56,391
what things can I set as my constants that make sense.

581
00:24:56,393 --> 00:24:58,192
You gotta learn all that by doing, okay.

582
00:24:58,194 --> 00:25:00,994
I could spend many days going through every possible one.

583
00:25:03,532 --> 00:25:05,932
Autolayout can be done in code.

584
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:08,568
There are objects, classes,

585
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,737
in iOS that represent what's going on in autolayout.

586
00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:14,273
And in the demo I'm gonna actually show you an example

587
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:16,475
of doing that so you can get an idea of what it looks like.

588
00:25:16,477 --> 00:25:17,909
But we rarely do that.

589
00:25:17,911 --> 00:25:20,611
If we can do it in the storyboard, we do it there.

590
00:25:20,613 --> 00:25:23,114
We only revert to doing it in code when it's like,

591
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:26,817
we just can't express that somehow in the storyboard,

592
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:28,418
which is extremely rare.

593
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,822
But I'll show you a case where that's true, but all right.

594
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:37,159
So what about rotation?

595
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,361
As I said, when you have rotation,

596
00:25:39,363 --> 00:25:44,065
you're just going to rely on your autolayout to do that.

597
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:48,935
But occasionally when you rotate, things have changed so

598
00:25:48,937 --> 00:25:52,339
drastically in terms of the shape that autolayout just

599
00:25:52,341 --> 00:25:53,206
can't do it.

600
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:55,408
It can't move a view where you want.

601
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,343
So what's an example of that?

602
00:25:57,345 --> 00:25:59,077
Lets consider our calculator.

603
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:01,813
Okay lets say we had 20 buttons in our calculator.

604
00:26:01,815 --> 00:26:02,447
Okay.

605
00:26:02,449 --> 00:26:04,816
Now in landscape,

606
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:07,184
I might want them to be five buttons across and four down.

607
00:26:07,186 --> 00:26:08,585
But when I switch to portrait,

608
00:26:08,587 --> 00:26:10,454
now I might want four across and five down.

609
00:26:11,823 --> 00:26:13,373
Okay, there's no

610
00:26:13,374 --> 00:26:14,924
way you're gonna write autolayout to do that.

611
00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:19,128
Autolayout cannot make such a huge change like doing that.

612
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,296
Okay, so how do we deal with that?

613
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:23,031
We still wanna do that, so how do we do it?

614
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:28,802
It's not just in the case of rotation where this is

615
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:30,003
happening to.

616
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,639
It also happens, for example, in a split view.

617
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:36,576
When you have the master in the spilt view on the left,

618
00:26:36,578 --> 00:26:39,612
it kind of is tall and thin, just like it was on an iPhone.

619
00:26:39,614 --> 00:26:42,047
Even though it was on an iPad, it's kind of in a shape,

620
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:44,850
a space that's shaped more like an iPhone, right?

621
00:26:44,852 --> 00:26:47,652
Lots of vertical space, but not much horizontal space.

622
00:26:47,654 --> 00:26:50,104
So it's not just rotation where we

623
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:52,555
care about this size business, the relative size of things.

624
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:57,694
So the solution to this is called size classes, and so

625
00:26:57,696 --> 00:27:00,697
your view controller always exists in

626
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:03,399
a size class environment.

627
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:05,100
For width and height.

628
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:08,703
And currently the size class can either be compact

629
00:27:08,705 --> 00:27:09,804
or regular.

630
00:27:09,806 --> 00:27:11,839
Regular just means it's not compact.

631
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:15,743
Okay, and so lets try and

632
00:27:15,745 --> 00:27:19,613
understand what when you're in these different situations.

633
00:27:19,615 --> 00:27:24,217
So for example the iPhone 6+ is an interesting device.

634
00:27:24,219 --> 00:27:27,920
In portrait it's width is compact.

635
00:27:27,922 --> 00:27:29,321
It's height is regular.

636
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,407
Okay so that's if you

637
00:27:32,408 --> 00:27:34,425
had like a full screen view controller on an iPhone 6+.

638
00:27:34,427 --> 00:27:37,795
When you go to landscape on the 6+ now it's compact in

639
00:27:37,797 --> 00:27:39,530
height and regular in width.

640
00:27:40,966 --> 00:27:42,399
That make sense?

641
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:44,901
All right, it makes perfect sense in that one.

642
00:27:44,903 --> 00:27:46,669
But the iPhone is kind of an interesting one,

643
00:27:46,671 --> 00:27:49,171
other iPhones besides the iPhone 6+,

644
00:27:49,173 --> 00:27:53,041
in portrait it is compact in width and regular in height,

645
00:27:53,043 --> 00:27:55,677
just like an iPhone 6+, but in landscaped,

646
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,147
it is considered compact in width and compact in height.

647
00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:02,383
And that might seem non-intuitive,.

648
00:28:02,385 --> 00:28:06,653
But it just turns out that a non iPhone 6+, the width of

649
00:28:06,655 --> 00:28:09,823
it is just not quite enough to say this is a regular width.

650
00:28:09,825 --> 00:28:12,492
Most UIs just will look better if you

651
00:28:12,494 --> 00:28:14,994
consider it compact, okay?

652
00:28:14,996 --> 00:28:18,964
Now the iPad is always regular in both directions.

653
00:28:18,966 --> 00:28:20,632
Portrait or landscape, it's always so

654
00:28:20,634 --> 00:28:22,734
big that it's just regular in both directions.

655
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:24,635
There's no compact on the iPad.

656
00:28:24,637 --> 00:28:26,370
But again a particular view controller on

657
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:27,904
an iPad like the master of

658
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:31,074
a split view side by side that's going to be compact.

659
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:34,844
Regular height, compact width.

660
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,947
All right, this whole thing is extensible it's not kinda all

661
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,715
frozen in stone.

662
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,983
You if you have a view controller you can find out

663
00:28:41,985 --> 00:28:45,987
your size class by using this property called trait

664
00:28:45,989 --> 00:28:47,121
collection.

665
00:28:47,123 --> 00:28:48,489
And inside traitCollection,

666
00:28:48,491 --> 00:28:50,957
it's gonna return the horizontal size class and

667
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:52,976
the vertical size class,

668
00:28:52,977 --> 00:28:54,994
and that's just an enum that's either .Compact or

669
00:28:54,996 --> 00:28:56,429
.Regular, okay?

670
00:28:56,431 --> 00:29:00,232
Now, you probably almost never need to do this because you're

671
00:29:00,234 --> 00:29:03,669
gonna edit this in your storyboard, 'kay?

672
00:29:03,671 --> 00:29:07,039
You're going to set up your storyboard to deal with

673
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:08,573
size classes.

674
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:10,942
And then your code, it's just all gonna work.

675
00:29:10,944 --> 00:29:12,176
Okay as long as you got your

676
00:29:12,178 --> 00:29:14,111
rest of your auto layout going.

677
00:29:14,113 --> 00:29:16,130
So how does that work?

678
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:18,148
All right so here's the size classes right horizontal and

679
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,383
vertical, compact and regular.

680
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:21,918
See these four boxes right,

681
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,086
that's every possible combination.

682
00:29:24,088 --> 00:29:27,956
Okay and so for my calculator for example here's what

683
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:30,992
my UI might look like in those situations.

684
00:29:30,994 --> 00:29:33,995
Okay you see here that I've gone five across and four

685
00:29:33,997 --> 00:29:39,467
down when I have a compact height and regular width.

686
00:29:39,469 --> 00:29:47,507
But I basically anytime I have a regular width I'm gonna

687
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:51,711
go what did I do, every time I actually every time I have.

688
00:29:51,713 --> 00:29:57,449
A regular height, I go five high.

689
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:01,953
Okay so lower right is regular height, it's five high.

690
00:30:01,955 --> 00:30:04,422
Lower left is regular height is five high.

691
00:30:04,424 --> 00:30:06,490
The top two are compact height,

692
00:30:06,492 --> 00:30:10,093
I've gone to four high five wide.

693
00:30:10,095 --> 00:30:12,028
Okay.

694
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:13,962
So it'd be kinda a pain though if I had to do all four of

695
00:30:13,965 --> 00:30:16,866
these for every user interface I built.

696
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:20,703
So we actually have another size class called any.

697
00:30:20,705 --> 00:30:23,872
And if you throw any into the mix,

698
00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:27,642
now I can do this exactly the way I just said which is.

699
00:30:27,644 --> 00:30:31,245
Any, first of all I'm gonna have an any any,

700
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,347
which is the middle, and that's gonna be my base UI.

701
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:38,018
So, if I don't specify any particular size class, it's

702
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,453
gonna look like that, which is four across and five down.

703
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:44,289
But in the case where it's vertically compact.

704
00:30:45,793 --> 00:30:48,727
I'm going to go to five across and only four high.

705
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:50,361
And I don't care what the width is so

706
00:30:50,363 --> 00:30:51,629
that's why it's any.

707
00:30:51,631 --> 00:30:53,664
So now I only have to do two user interfaces.

708
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:57,134
My main user interface, the any any and one other one

709
00:30:57,136 --> 00:30:59,602
which is I'm in a compact vertical situation so

710
00:30:59,604 --> 00:31:00,436
I want to go four high.

711
00:31:01,673 --> 00:31:04,273
Okay so this makes it a little easier now I only have to do

712
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:06,208
things and

713
00:31:06,209 --> 00:31:08,142
still covers all the same bases as the previous slide.

714
00:31:08,145 --> 00:31:12,480
And incredibly, Interface Builder will have a graph that

715
00:31:12,482 --> 00:31:15,750
looks almost exactly like this slide that lets you pick

716
00:31:15,752 --> 00:31:18,752
between these various boxes, and you can design your

717
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:20,854
user interface in any of these boxes.

718
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,222
Okay? And it will

719
00:31:23,224 --> 00:31:24,457
just magically work.

720
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:26,892
So let's take a look at a demo here.

721
00:31:26,894 --> 00:31:28,293
I actually have a couple of demos.

722
00:31:28,295 --> 00:31:30,628
The one is called ShowSizeClass,

723
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:35,099
it's just an app that I wrote that shows the size

724
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,369
class of whatever device you're on at the time.

725
00:31:38,371 --> 00:31:39,553
Okay?

726
00:31:39,554 --> 00:31:40,736
And we're gonna take a look at the code for that.

727
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:43,173
And then I'm gonna do an app from scratch.

728
00:31:43,175 --> 00:31:45,208
Which is called Autolayout.

729
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,575
That's the name of my app.

730
00:31:46,577 --> 00:31:47,943
Add it's just gonna have some

731
00:31:47,944 --> 00:31:49,310
very interesting autolayout things including

732
00:31:49,313 --> 00:31:52,080
the size class problem that we're gonna have to solve.

733
00:31:52,082 --> 00:31:53,615
Okay so it's kind of kitchen sink of that.

734
00:31:53,617 --> 00:31:55,516
All right let's go and

735
00:31:55,518 --> 00:31:59,520
look at this app I wrote called ShowSizeClass.

736
00:31:59,522 --> 00:32:00,821
So here's ShowSizeClass, and

737
00:32:00,823 --> 00:32:02,956
I'm just going to run this on some various devices.

738
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:06,459
Let's run this on an iPhone 6 Plus for example.

739
00:32:07,695 --> 00:32:09,795
Here's an iPhone 6 Plus.

740
00:32:09,797 --> 00:32:10,962
How do I make this small?

741
00:32:10,964 --> 00:32:12,447
I guess I can't.

742
00:32:12,448 --> 00:32:13,931
This is as small as I can make it.

743
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:17,301
You see how iPhone 6 Plus in portrait here

744
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:19,403
is horizontally compact.

745
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:22,039
And it's regular vertically.

746
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:22,872
That's what the green means.

747
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,559
Okay?

748
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,144
If I rotate it, it's regular horizontally and

749
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:30,112
compact vertically.

750
00:32:31,381 --> 00:32:32,280
Everybody cool with that?

751
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:34,248
All right. Now,

752
00:32:34,249 --> 00:32:35,081
let's look on the iPhone 6.

753
00:32:40,155 --> 00:32:41,954
All right, iPhone 6 again,

754
00:32:41,956 --> 00:32:44,557
regular vertically, compact width.

755
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,125
But if we rotate, it's compact in both directions.

756
00:32:49,162 --> 00:32:53,698
Okay, let's go to like iPhone 4s or something like that.

757
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:00,637
Okay, so here's 4S.

758
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:02,405
It's also, even though it's kind of short,

759
00:33:02,407 --> 00:33:04,640
it's still considered regular vertically.

760
00:33:04,642 --> 00:33:06,075
And compact this way,

761
00:33:06,077 --> 00:33:09,345
and compact in both directions just like an iPhone 6.

762
00:33:09,347 --> 00:33:11,897
Okay?

763
00:33:11,898 --> 00:33:14,448
And lastly, let's take a quick look at iPad2, or any iPad.

764
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:17,085
I do iPad too because it fits on this screen.

765
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:18,820
All the rest of them are too high of resolution again.

766
00:33:18,822 --> 00:33:20,154
All right, look, see.

767
00:33:20,156 --> 00:33:23,090
It's regular this way and regular both ways,

768
00:33:23,092 --> 00:33:24,658
this way, okay.

769
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,794
So let's look at the app that I wrote to do that.

770
00:33:27,796 --> 00:33:30,963
I keep going back here to iPhone 6.

771
00:33:34,802 --> 00:33:37,836
Okay, let's look at the app that I wrote.

772
00:33:37,838 --> 00:33:40,172
Here it is, ShowSizeClass.

773
00:33:40,174 --> 00:33:42,040
It has a storyboard here.

774
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:43,975
Here's its storyboard.

775
00:33:43,976 --> 00:33:45,909
Let's see if we can find anything in the storyboard.

776
00:33:45,912 --> 00:33:47,545
There it is, okay.

777
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:48,779
Hm, nteresting.

778
00:33:48,781 --> 00:33:52,148
This storyboard, there's no arrows.

779
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:54,750
There's the dot in the middle, but

780
00:33:54,752 --> 00:33:55,751
where the heck did those arrows?

781
00:33:55,753 --> 00:33:57,219
Oh, I must draw them in my code.

782
00:33:57,221 --> 00:33:58,586
Let's look at the View control.

783
00:33:58,588 --> 00:34:00,855
Oh, my View control had no code.

784
00:34:00,857 --> 00:34:02,556
This app has no code.

785
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,560
How is it possible that it drew those arrows, okay?

786
00:34:06,562 --> 00:34:11,097
Well, the answer is that those arrows are only drawn for

787
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:13,132
the SizeClass in question.

788
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,401
So for

789
00:34:15,402 --> 00:34:17,669
example if I have something that is horizontally compact I

790
00:34:17,672 --> 00:34:20,839
draw those two red arrows and where is that, well

791
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:24,042
look down at the bottom of the screen here it says any any.

792
00:34:24,044 --> 00:34:27,112
So this is the user interface if you're in any any

793
00:34:27,114 --> 00:34:29,747
the default user interface okay.

794
00:34:29,749 --> 00:34:33,617
If I click on this right here I can pick any of

795
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:36,487
those nine boxes that I showed on that slide.

796
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:38,789
So for example look at this box right here.

797
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:42,759
This is any width but a compact height.

798
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:45,094
Now when I click here its actually gonna change my user

799
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:48,030
interface and show me what the user interface looks like on

800
00:34:48,032 --> 00:34:51,266
a device that is any width but a compact height.

801
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:56,571
See, these are just two labels I threw out here that do

802
00:34:56,573 --> 00:35:00,174
that and same thing let's say over here, any height,

803
00:35:00,176 --> 00:35:01,041
compact width.

804
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:06,679
Or, over here we have regular width, any height.

805
00:35:08,282 --> 00:35:10,349
And over here we have any width,

806
00:35:10,351 --> 00:35:12,017
regular height, yeah, there we go.

807
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:13,218
So that's it.

808
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:14,418
That's my entire user interface.

809
00:35:14,421 --> 00:35:19,456
I just put the arrows in whichever SizeClass was

810
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:21,792
appropriate there.

811
00:35:22,961 --> 00:35:25,828
This is really cool to be able to go here and basically edit

812
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:28,164
your user interface in any of these circumstances.

813
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:29,698
Including specific ones,

814
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,500
like this Compact Width Compact Height.

815
00:35:31,502 --> 00:35:33,535
That's basically, you're editing your user

816
00:35:33,537 --> 00:35:37,138
interface for non-iPhone 6 Pluses in Landscape.

817
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,840
Because that's the only one that is both Compact Width and

818
00:35:39,842 --> 00:35:41,275
Compact Height.

819
00:35:41,277 --> 00:35:42,510
Okay?

820
00:35:42,511 --> 00:35:43,744
So you could actually have a specific one just for

821
00:35:43,746 --> 00:35:45,478
that circumstance.

822
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,579
Okay? But it's nicer to

823
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:49,415
have these Anys, to use these Anys out here so

824
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:51,850
that they'll work, and we'll see in the demo.

825
00:35:51,852 --> 00:35:54,353
And one of the things I challenged,

826
00:35:54,355 --> 00:35:56,054
I didn't really talk about it in the slides there,

827
00:35:56,056 --> 00:35:58,756
but I challenged you to do is, I actually added this as an

828
00:35:58,758 --> 00:36:01,258
extra credit to the homework number three, if you want.

829
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,711
Go back and

830
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,163
make your calculator user interface look different.

831
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:07,731
In different SizeClasses.

832
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:11,034
Maybe do five buttons by four instead of four by five,

833
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:12,335
okay, or something like that.

834
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:15,804
Or even, some ones have more buttons.

835
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,807
If you look at the calculator that Apple ships on

836
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,675
the iPhone, when you go to Landscape,

837
00:36:20,677 --> 00:36:22,110
it has a lot more operations.

838
00:36:22,112 --> 00:36:23,277
The buttons are all smaller, but

839
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:25,879
it has a lot of operations that aren't even there.

840
00:36:25,881 --> 00:36:27,714
And you can do that with side classes as well.

841
00:36:29,017 --> 00:36:32,785
Okay, alright so

842
00:36:32,787 --> 00:36:35,054
now we're gonna write an app here from scratch.

843
00:36:36,957 --> 00:36:39,958
And it is going to look like this.

844
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,160
Okay here's what it's UIs gonna look like.

845
00:36:42,162 --> 00:36:43,661
It's very, very, this is a demo, okay,

846
00:36:43,663 --> 00:36:45,429
so it's a very simple app.

847
00:36:45,431 --> 00:36:48,165
It asks for a username and password up here, so

848
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:52,869
I have madbum, and password is foo.

849
00:36:52,871 --> 00:36:56,005
Now, I can change the security on my password.

850
00:36:56,007 --> 00:37:00,475
I can have it be secured so I can't see it, okay.

851
00:37:00,477 --> 00:37:03,445
But when I log in, it's gonna show me.

852
00:37:03,447 --> 00:37:06,514
An icon for the person,

853
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:09,582
the persons name, and what company they work for, okay.

854
00:37:09,585 --> 00:37:11,485
Madison Bumgarner in this case.

855
00:37:11,487 --> 00:37:15,088
And if I rotate it's gonna say the same information but

856
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:19,192
notice that this is not below here,

857
00:37:19,194 --> 00:37:22,895
it's actually moved to be beside it.

858
00:37:23,931 --> 00:37:25,881
Okay?

859
00:37:25,882 --> 00:37:27,832
So, basically, on Sizeclasses that are regular height, or

860
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:30,068
have a lot of room, I put the words at the bottom.

861
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:33,604
I try to use this space to show their picture more.

862
00:37:33,606 --> 00:37:38,475
And in other SizeClasses, I put it off to the side, okay?

863
00:37:38,477 --> 00:37:44,914
And we have other users here, like, Same password.

864
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:49,151
Okay it's all got all the different icon or old j apple.

865
00:37:51,088 --> 00:37:52,487
Okay John Appleseed.

866
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:55,490
Okay? In all of these cases

867
00:37:55,492 --> 00:37:56,223
it's going to do that.

868
00:37:57,259 --> 00:38:00,127
Okay so lot going on here to make this work with

869
00:38:00,129 --> 00:38:01,161
auto layout.

870
00:38:01,163 --> 00:38:02,562
Right you got

871
00:38:02,563 --> 00:38:03,962
this thing automatically changing right here.

872
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:06,332
You've got this you've got this image here which you

873
00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:09,001
want to be the right aspect ration.

874
00:38:09,003 --> 00:38:11,403
You know we got he SizeClass things so

875
00:38:11,405 --> 00:38:14,172
we can put the words underneath when it's tall etc.

876
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:16,640
Okay.

877
00:38:16,642 --> 00:38:18,775
So that's what we're going to build.

878
00:38:18,777 --> 00:38:22,612
Alright, let's go and we're going to start from

879
00:38:22,614 --> 00:38:25,148
scratch as I like to do usually, so

880
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,950
it's creating a new XCode project, iOS application.

881
00:38:27,952 --> 00:38:29,618
I'm going to call it auto layout, okay.

882
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:33,355
I'm going to put it the same place I put all of my

883
00:38:33,357 --> 00:38:34,455
apps there.

884
00:38:34,457 --> 00:38:36,424
Here it is.

885
00:38:36,425 --> 00:38:38,392
I'm gonna move this app delegate out of the way.

886
00:38:38,394 --> 00:38:40,027
And the launch screen out of the way.

887
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:41,928
For the first time we're actually gonna

888
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,698
talk about these image assets here today.

889
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,432
It's a good opportunity to talk about that.

890
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:48,734
Okay. And in my controller,

891
00:38:48,736 --> 00:38:49,968
I'm gonna clear out this code.

892
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,569
Don't need any of that.

893
00:38:51,571 --> 00:38:53,137
By the way, the things that I cleared out here,

894
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:54,739
you starting to recognize them?

895
00:38:54,741 --> 00:38:56,340
View controller life cycle methods.

896
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:58,108
Okay.

897
00:38:59,177 --> 00:39:02,511
But if I need those, I'll put them back but okay.

898
00:39:03,714 --> 00:39:05,914
So, let's go to our storyboard and start building this UI.

899
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:09,984
Now this is gonna be a lot of clicking things around.

900
00:39:09,986 --> 00:39:12,019
I'm gonna make this as big as possible for us here.

901
00:39:12,021 --> 00:39:15,589
That's all right, that there.

902
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:19,926
Lot of graphical things happening.

903
00:39:19,928 --> 00:39:20,559
Let's just do that.

904
00:39:22,063 --> 00:39:25,030
Okay, so I'm gonna start with those text fields at

905
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:26,531
the top, right?

906
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:28,633
I need a username and password text field.

907
00:39:28,635 --> 00:39:32,003
So I'm gonna go down here and grab a text field.

908
00:39:32,005 --> 00:39:34,471
Okay, this is actually gonna be an editable one, so

909
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:36,973
I grab this one, text, not label, but text.

910
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:40,377
And I'm going to put it up in the upper corner to start.

911
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:43,112
Grab another one, put this here.

912
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,581
Okay, now, I'm gonna use some model layout stuff you

913
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:46,248
already know about.

914
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,582
I'm gonna use Ctrll drag.

915
00:39:47,584 --> 00:39:50,919
Let's stick this one trailing space to that edge.

916
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,854
Let's stick this one with this trailing space to that end.

917
00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:55,256
Let's get this one to the top.

918
00:39:55,258 --> 00:39:56,423
Let's put a space in

919
00:39:56,425 --> 00:39:58,892
between the vertical space between them.

920
00:39:58,894 --> 00:39:59,793
You know about.

921
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:01,394
Doing all those kind of things.

922
00:40:01,396 --> 00:40:04,397
Now one thing as I'm working with auto layout I

923
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:07,799
often like to click this little button right here.

924
00:40:08,735 --> 00:40:10,535
Because this will

925
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:12,336
give you a little summary of what's going on.

926
00:40:13,473 --> 00:40:16,373
And when all it's complaining about is that frames are gonna

927
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,810
be moved, a cool thing you can do is go down here

928
00:40:19,812 --> 00:40:21,411
to this button.

929
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:24,881
The same one where we do Reset to Suggested Constraints and

930
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:27,717
Clear Constraints, there's this Update Frame.

931
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:33,789
And it will update all frames in your storyboard.

932
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:35,990
Now, it made those smaller because the text in

933
00:40:35,992 --> 00:40:38,059
them is small, but don't worry about that.

934
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,326
We're gonna fix that later.

935
00:40:39,328 --> 00:40:41,829
So I did Undo right there because I wanted them to be

936
00:40:41,831 --> 00:40:44,698
a little bigger just as I work.

937
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,832
Okay? But I'll be going back to

938
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:47,400
look at this often.

939
00:40:47,402 --> 00:40:48,734
And if I see it's just frames,

940
00:40:48,736 --> 00:40:50,202
then I'll be doing Update Frames.

941
00:40:50,204 --> 00:40:51,636
And if I don't like what it did I

942
00:40:51,638 --> 00:40:52,804
can always undo, keep going.

943
00:40:52,806 --> 00:40:54,405
All right?

944
00:40:54,407 --> 00:40:58,175
So let's go and do our things here for

945
00:40:58,177 --> 00:41:02,846
the user name and password fields.

946
00:41:02,848 --> 00:41:04,914
So I'm just going to put some text in these.

947
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:05,915
Password.

948
00:41:07,185 --> 00:41:09,351
User name, so

949
00:41:09,353 --> 00:41:12,421
these ones I kind of want to be on the left.

950
00:41:12,423 --> 00:41:13,588
Okay, if you remember.

951
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,590
So I'm gonna do the same thing here with control drag.

952
00:41:15,592 --> 00:41:18,125
Let's set that leaning space.

953
00:41:18,127 --> 00:41:19,993
Let's set that leaning space.

954
00:41:19,995 --> 00:41:21,294
Let's set this thing to the,

955
00:41:21,296 --> 00:41:22,929
actually I'm not even gonna set this to the top.

956
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:24,464
Now this is an interesting one.

957
00:41:24,466 --> 00:41:26,766
So I have these two guys right here.

958
00:41:26,768 --> 00:41:30,069
Really what I want them to do is be lined up with whatever

959
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,136
the text is in here.

960
00:41:31,138 --> 00:41:33,938
I wanna line them up by their baselines.

961
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,842
So I'm gonna control drag between the two of them and

962
00:41:37,844 --> 00:41:40,310
go down here and pick Baseline.

963
00:41:40,312 --> 00:41:43,313
So this is going to line up their baselines.

964
00:41:43,315 --> 00:41:44,314
Okay?

965
00:41:44,316 --> 00:41:47,016
Same thing here, drag this one.

966
00:41:47,018 --> 00:41:48,918
And line up their baselines there.

967
00:41:50,087 --> 00:41:53,155
Now, another thing I want is that I want them to be kind

968
00:41:53,157 --> 00:41:54,989
of, well, I want these two guys, username and

969
00:41:54,991 --> 00:41:57,458
password, to be the same width.

970
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,260
So, I'm control dragging between them and

971
00:41:59,262 --> 00:42:01,095
saying Equal Widths.

972
00:42:01,097 --> 00:42:03,364
You remember in the calculator we

973
00:42:03,365 --> 00:42:05,632
did the equal widths down here with this thing, okay?

974
00:42:05,634 --> 00:42:07,300
But, you can do it with control drag as well.

975
00:42:08,436 --> 00:42:10,469
And then also I want these things attached.

976
00:42:10,471 --> 00:42:13,539
So I want that thing attached to each other so

977
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:15,674
that its horizontal spacing is set.

978
00:42:15,676 --> 00:42:17,509
And I want this thing attached to this,

979
00:42:17,511 --> 00:42:18,476
its horizontal spacing.

980
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:22,179
Now I've done all this stuff even though

981
00:42:22,181 --> 00:42:24,648
they're really not where I want them right now.

982
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:27,650
So usually you can kinda set things up and

983
00:42:27,652 --> 00:42:30,620
then just go into the size inspector.

984
00:42:30,622 --> 00:42:32,722
And inspect all of them and

985
00:42:32,724 --> 00:42:35,057
get rid of every magic number you see.

986
00:42:36,493 --> 00:42:38,760
If you get rid of every magic number you see usually it's

987
00:42:38,762 --> 00:42:40,294
gonna do exactly what you want.

988
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:41,996
So lets go here, lets start with this one.

989
00:42:41,998 --> 00:42:43,030
Lets find some magic numbers.

990
00:42:43,032 --> 00:42:44,731
Look at this Leading Space Username.

991
00:42:44,733 --> 00:42:46,366
[SOUND] Magic number.

992
00:42:46,368 --> 00:42:48,735
Okay magic number means number in here,

993
00:42:48,737 --> 00:42:51,103
anything that's a number get rid of it.

994
00:42:51,105 --> 00:42:52,137
So 392 I'm gonna get rid of that,

995
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:54,473
I'm gonna do it by going up here.

996
00:42:54,475 --> 00:42:57,075
Instead of having 392,

997
00:42:57,076 --> 00:42:59,676
I'm going to pick Standard Value, okay?

998
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:00,878
So now it's gone.

999
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,212
So you can click on these things and

1000
00:43:02,214 --> 00:43:04,481
click Edit to get rid of these.

1001
00:43:04,483 --> 00:43:08,084
Even 8, which had got by the blue lines, okay?

1002
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,452
I don't like that either.

1003
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:10,819
I'm just going to go here and say zero, because

1004
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:13,956
I want that to be right up against the edge, okay?

1005
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,458
Oops. Sorry.

1006
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,294
Same thing, oh, did I do the right thing there?

1007
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:22,364
Leading space, username, yeah, trailing spaces, you're right.

1008
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:23,949
How about this one?

1009
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,533
Top Space to Top Layout right here,

1010
00:43:25,535 --> 00:43:26,867
I'll use the Standard Value for that.

1011
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:28,135
Okay?

1012
00:43:28,137 --> 00:43:30,270
Oops, sorry, keep clicking there.

1013
00:43:30,272 --> 00:43:33,340
And then here, Align Baseline equals three.

1014
00:43:33,342 --> 00:43:36,609
Okay I want these baselines exactly aligned not three off

1015
00:43:36,611 --> 00:43:39,912
of each other so I'm gonna say zero right here.

1016
00:43:39,914 --> 00:43:44,249
So I've gotten rid of all the magic numbers in here.

1017
00:43:44,251 --> 00:43:46,351
Okay now lets do it for

1018
00:43:46,352 --> 00:43:48,452
this one, okay this one also has a magic number here,

1019
00:43:48,455 --> 00:43:51,622
lets change that to be Standard Value.

1020
00:43:51,624 --> 00:43:53,391
We got this one, Align Baseline.

1021
00:43:53,393 --> 00:43:54,658
We want that to be zero.

1022
00:43:55,928 --> 00:43:57,060
Okay? So we got rid of that.

1023
00:43:57,062 --> 00:43:57,827
How about this one?

1024
00:43:57,829 --> 00:44:00,396
Oh, this one's good.

1025
00:44:00,398 --> 00:44:01,497
No magic value.

1026
00:44:01,499 --> 00:44:03,165
And this one, also good.

1027
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:04,165
Okay? All is good.

1028
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:05,833
All is well with the world.

1029
00:44:05,835 --> 00:44:07,118
Okay?

1030
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,402
But we still have this up here.

1031
00:44:08,404 --> 00:44:10,237
Frame will be different at run time, so

1032
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:12,005
I'm going to go down here.

1033
00:44:12,007 --> 00:44:14,874
And update our frames and this looks good.

1034
00:44:14,876 --> 00:44:17,910
Now, when I look at this I'm like that's really not what I

1035
00:44:17,912 --> 00:44:20,946
want, so I must have made a mistake.

1036
00:44:20,948 --> 00:44:23,082
For example, I want this spacing in-between not to

1037
00:44:23,084 --> 00:44:24,817
be zero, so

1038
00:44:24,818 --> 00:44:26,551
I typed zero somewhere where I wanted a standard value.

1039
00:44:26,553 --> 00:44:29,220
So, let's go back here and see where that is.

1040
00:44:29,222 --> 00:44:30,588
Okay? It looks like it's this one

1041
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:33,157
you can tell when you mouse over these, it tells you.

1042
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:34,692
So here let's go back to here and

1043
00:44:34,694 --> 00:44:37,894
instead of zero, let's say Standard Value, okay?

1044
00:44:37,896 --> 00:44:39,829
And it moved it there for us.

1045
00:44:40,999 --> 00:44:42,065
Sometimes it moves it,

1046
00:44:42,066 --> 00:44:43,132
sometimes you need to do update frames.

1047
00:44:43,134 --> 00:44:44,300
It just kind of depends on

1048
00:44:44,301 --> 00:44:45,467
the character of the change you're making.

1049
00:44:47,804 --> 00:44:49,103
Okay?

1050
00:44:49,105 --> 00:44:51,238
Now, here's a really cool thing.

1051
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,124
I want to see what

1052
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:55,009
this looks like in portrait and landscape.

1053
00:44:55,011 --> 00:44:57,144
So yeah, I could go up here and hit Run,

1054
00:44:57,146 --> 00:45:00,380
but there is a lot faster way, which is to open up

1055
00:45:01,883 --> 00:45:05,384
the assistant editor here and instead of showing your view

1056
00:45:05,386 --> 00:45:08,253
controller, go up here and go down to Preview.

1057
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:11,522
This will preview your UI.

1058
00:45:13,259 --> 00:45:15,726
Okay? And you can preview it in

1059
00:45:16,795 --> 00:45:18,795
either landscape or portrait.

1060
00:45:18,797 --> 00:45:21,564
You can also preview it on other devices like

1061
00:45:21,566 --> 00:45:25,000
maybe an iPhone 6 Plus, okay, which is kind of so

1062
00:45:25,002 --> 00:45:28,303
big that we can't barely even see it here.

1063
00:45:28,305 --> 00:45:30,238
Barely flip it around, okay?

1064
00:45:31,174 --> 00:45:33,341
Or you can even look at it on an iPad if you wanted.

1065
00:45:34,276 --> 00:45:38,111
Okay I think four inches works best for

1066
00:45:38,113 --> 00:45:39,846
this small resolution I have.

1067
00:45:39,848 --> 00:45:43,549
But this is really cool, now this can only preview your UI

1068
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,651
for things that aren't running your code.

1069
00:45:45,653 --> 00:45:47,419
Okay so if you're gonna do something that you need to

1070
00:45:47,421 --> 00:45:49,587
run your code then you need to go run it in the app.

1071
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:51,256
But if you just want to

1072
00:45:51,257 --> 00:45:52,924
see how is the auto layout gonna work.

1073
00:45:52,926 --> 00:45:54,876
You can do this.

1074
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,827
Now another thing that's cool here is what's this gonna look

1075
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:59,596
like when you give it off to your localization guys and

1076
00:45:59,598 --> 00:46:03,500
if this gets translated to German or something like that.

1077
00:46:03,502 --> 00:46:05,602
You can do that, you can kinda make sure that you

1078
00:46:05,604 --> 00:46:07,837
don't have any big problems by going down here,

1079
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,772
see where it says English.

1080
00:46:09,774 --> 00:46:10,739
Sort of click on that.

1081
00:46:11,942 --> 00:46:14,476
And we can go to this double length pseudo language.

1082
00:46:14,478 --> 00:46:17,611
And all that does is doubles every text.

1083
00:46:19,081 --> 00:46:22,416
Okay? So even a long translation of

1084
00:46:22,418 --> 00:46:25,118
the word Username would fit there.

1085
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,420
And my auto layout is working properly.

1086
00:46:27,422 --> 00:46:29,689
And so my translation is just going to work.

1087
00:46:29,691 --> 00:46:31,824
So Auto Layout is not just used for

1088
00:46:31,826 --> 00:46:33,325
landscape versus portrait or whatever.

1089
00:46:33,327 --> 00:46:35,226
It can be used for translation as well.

1090
00:46:35,228 --> 00:46:36,694
When you're localizing things,

1091
00:46:36,696 --> 00:46:38,896
you want auto-layout to make things fit.

1092
00:46:38,898 --> 00:46:43,266
Okay? Everyone understand that?

1093
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:44,034
Okay.

1094
00:46:44,036 --> 00:46:44,934
All right, good.

1095
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:46,602
So we're making progress here.

1096
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:49,438
By the way, you probably don't wanna have preview open as

1097
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,605
you're doing a lot of changes here,

1098
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,008
cuz it's gonna be constantly previewing in real time.

1099
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,709
So if you've got a really powerful machine,

1100
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:56,060
it could keep up, but

1101
00:46:56,061 --> 00:46:57,410
you might be asking it to do a lot of calculations.

1102
00:46:57,413 --> 00:46:59,947
So I usually close that while I'm working, and

1103
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:01,548
then just bring it back whenever I wanna preview.

1104
00:47:02,718 --> 00:47:04,417
So let's do those two buttons.

1105
00:47:04,419 --> 00:47:06,452
Remember, I had the button change security,

1106
00:47:06,454 --> 00:47:08,020
which changed this to secure, and

1107
00:47:08,022 --> 00:47:10,255
then I had the button login, so let's go ahead and do that.

1108
00:47:11,258 --> 00:47:13,157
Another trick I'm going to show you is, and

1109
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:16,227
I'm always scrolling around in here trying to find things.

1110
00:47:16,229 --> 00:47:18,195
You can actually find things real quick by going down to

1111
00:47:18,197 --> 00:47:19,763
the bottom here and typing like button.

1112
00:47:19,765 --> 00:47:23,199
Now it's only going to show you the buttons.

1113
00:47:23,201 --> 00:47:25,001
Okay? We got Bar Button and

1114
00:47:25,003 --> 00:47:27,503
here's regular button, so I'm going to drag that out.

1115
00:47:27,505 --> 00:47:29,338
Let's get a couple of those buttons.

1116
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:33,408
We'll call this one Change security.

1117
00:47:34,444 --> 00:47:35,810
We'll call this one log in.

1118
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,612
Okay now where do these want to be?

1119
00:47:38,614 --> 00:47:40,347
They kind of

1120
00:47:40,348 --> 00:47:42,081
want to be underneath there something like that.

1121
00:47:42,084 --> 00:47:45,084
Definitely I like their baselines lined

1122
00:47:45,086 --> 00:47:46,619
up right there.

1123
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,153
So let's go ahead and kind of put those in position.

1124
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:51,490
I'm gonna set the vertical spacing between the login and

1125
00:47:51,492 --> 00:47:52,791
this guy right here and

1126
00:47:52,793 --> 00:47:56,461
then I'm control dragging here to set the baselines the same.

1127
00:47:56,463 --> 00:47:58,947
Okay?

1128
00:47:58,948 --> 00:48:01,432
Now, that has actually set the vertical position of both of

1129
00:48:01,434 --> 00:48:03,066
these things, okay.

1130
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:05,135
Because the vertical position of these are set and so

1131
00:48:05,137 --> 00:48:07,070
when I tie this vertical position here and

1132
00:48:07,072 --> 00:48:10,306
the baseline which is a vertical positioning here but

1133
00:48:10,308 --> 00:48:13,776
if I go up here it says that the horizontal position of

1134
00:48:13,778 --> 00:48:16,445
Login and Change Security is ambiguous.

1135
00:48:16,447 --> 00:48:17,712
Which makes sense.

1136
00:48:17,714 --> 00:48:19,213
I haven't really specified where these

1137
00:48:19,215 --> 00:48:19,914
things are supposed to be.

1138
00:48:19,916 --> 00:48:21,799
Just because I put them on

1139
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,683
the screen doesn't mean that there's an auto layout rule.

1140
00:48:23,686 --> 00:48:25,452
Now, what do I want it to be?

1141
00:48:25,454 --> 00:48:28,621
Well, I kind of want them to be some reasonable distance

1142
00:48:28,623 --> 00:48:30,590
apart so it doesn't look like, you know,

1143
00:48:30,592 --> 00:48:32,058
this is part of the same thing.

1144
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,593
That would look like change security log in is one thing.

1145
00:48:34,595 --> 00:48:37,062
So I want them apart a little bit.

1146
00:48:37,064 --> 00:48:39,664
But otherwise I want them centered on the screen.

1147
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,532
I want the pair of them centered.

1148
00:48:41,534 --> 00:48:44,702
Now, there's no auto layout rule that says that.

1149
00:48:44,704 --> 00:48:47,471
That's too complicated, okay?

1150
00:48:47,473 --> 00:48:50,841
But, I can easily do this with a little creativity, and

1151
00:48:50,843 --> 00:48:51,941
when you start doing auto layout,

1152
00:48:51,943 --> 00:48:54,243
you start realizing, hm, how can I do that?

1153
00:48:54,245 --> 00:48:56,512
Well, I need to be creative in how I'm gonna approach this.

1154
00:48:56,514 --> 00:48:59,748
[NOISE] And in this case what I'm gonna do is

1155
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:04,352
I'm gonna create two little spacer views on the side here.

1156
00:49:04,354 --> 00:49:06,354
And I'm gonna set them to be the same width.

1157
00:49:06,356 --> 00:49:09,357
Can you see how that's gonna make it so

1158
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,126
these two kinda get pushed into the middle?

1159
00:49:12,128 --> 00:49:14,428
Right, by the same amount on each side.

1160
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:16,697
So how would I do that?

1161
00:49:16,698 --> 00:49:18,965
So I'm gonna do that by just grabbing some views,

1162
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:20,750
just generic views,

1163
00:49:20,751 --> 00:49:22,534
okay, this just a generic view like the one you do to

1164
00:49:22,537 --> 00:49:24,337
do your graph view or the face view or whatever.

1165
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:27,506
When I'm working on it here, I'm going to give it

1166
00:49:27,508 --> 00:49:31,876
some background color so I can see the thing, okay,

1167
00:49:31,878 --> 00:49:36,013
now when I'm actually ready to go I will turn that back off.

1168
00:49:36,982 --> 00:49:40,317
And I'm just going to put them in here somewhere, copy and

1169
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,086
paste another one, put it over here somewhere, and

1170
00:49:43,088 --> 00:49:46,756
then I'm just gonna wire these up to how I want them,

1171
00:49:46,758 --> 00:49:49,158
so I want this to kind of be on that edge,

1172
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,859
I want this thing to be on that edge,

1173
00:49:51,995 --> 00:49:55,063
I want these two things to kind of be linked.

1174
00:49:55,065 --> 00:49:56,581
Okay.

1175
00:49:56,582 --> 00:49:58,098
Let's say I'll link their horizontal spacing.

1176
00:49:58,101 --> 00:49:59,066
Now here, I'm going to

1177
00:49:59,068 --> 00:50:00,768
set multiple things between these two.

1178
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:02,836
I'm gonna set the horizontal spacing and

1179
00:50:02,838 --> 00:50:04,904
then notice I'm holding down shift.

1180
00:50:04,906 --> 00:50:06,639
I'm also gonna set the top and

1181
00:50:06,641 --> 00:50:09,608
bottom of this view to match the top and bottom.

1182
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:11,577
Now, there's no base lines because this is not text.

1183
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:12,678
This is just a generic view.

1184
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,512
So I'm gonna move mine up the top and bottom.

1185
00:50:14,514 --> 00:50:16,781
So I can do Shift+click to do that.

1186
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:19,583
Okay. And then same thing over here,

1187
00:50:19,585 --> 00:50:21,752
I'm gonna do the same thing with these two guys.

1188
00:50:21,754 --> 00:50:26,923
I'm gonna set the top whoops, sorry, control drag.

1189
00:50:26,925 --> 00:50:30,492
I'm gonna set the top and bottom horizontal spacing.

1190
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:34,112
Okay.

1191
00:50:34,113 --> 00:50:35,729
Then I said I wanted to make this one and

1192
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:38,733
this one be equal widths.

1193
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:41,369
So I can just do that with control drag as well, so

1194
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,603
I've set that up.

1195
00:50:42,605 --> 00:50:45,505
I want this to be stuck to this edge, trailing space,

1196
00:50:45,507 --> 00:50:48,975
I want this to be stuck to this edge, leading space, and

1197
00:50:48,977 --> 00:50:52,478
I want these two guys to have some horizontal spacing,

1198
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,213
I'm not quite sure how much I want yet, but

1199
00:50:54,215 --> 00:50:56,448
I want some sort of horizontal spacing.

1200
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,885
Now, I've done this, and look, the yellow thing went away.

1201
00:50:59,887 --> 00:51:03,254
It says, okay, I know exactly where to put these things.
这个意思是Xcode已经知道这几个组件的确切位置了。

1202
00:51:03,256 --> 00:51:06,090
But this is really not where I want these put, okay?
但是这个不是我想要的确切位置。

1203
00:51:06,092 --> 00:51:09,260
Because I actually want this spacer right up against this,
因为我希望这个贴着这个，

1204
00:51:09,262 --> 00:51:11,161
and I want this spacer right up against this.
这个贴着这个。


1205
00:51:11,163 --> 00:51:13,663
So I'm gonna go through that same process again of
所以我要再做一次同样的事情来消除那些

1206
00:51:13,665 --> 00:51:15,699
getting rid of the magic number.
魔法数。

1207
00:51:15,701 --> 00:51:17,100
So let's start with this guy.
从这个开始。

1208
00:51:18,136 --> 00:51:20,969
And get rid of his magic numbers in the size inspector,
在尺寸检查器里消除掉它的魔法数。

1209
00:51:20,971 --> 00:51:22,771
so it's got this trailing space here,
来到尾部间距这里，

1210
00:51:22,773 --> 00:51:23,838
let's get rid of that.
消除掉它。

1211
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,407
We want that to be a standard value.
我们希望它是标准值。

1212
00:51:26,409 --> 00:51:29,777
Okay we got this one, we align the bottoms we want those to
到这里，它们应该底部是对齐的，

1213
00:51:29,779 --> 00:51:32,046
be exactly aligned, so we'll do zero.
所以这个应该是0.

1214
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:34,348
Same thing with top we want that exactly aligned, so
顶部应该也是对齐的，

1215
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:37,283
I got rid of all of the magic numbers for this.
这样魔法数就全没了。

1216
00:51:37,285 --> 00:51:38,518
How about this guy?
继续这个。

1217
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,518
Same thing.
还是一样的

1218
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,487
Okay? We want this to be standard value.
这我希望是标准值。

1220
00:51:42,489 --> 00:51:45,657
Usually I always put it to standard value
通常来说我都会选标准值，

1221
00:51:45,659 --> 00:51:47,925
unless standard value is not an option.
但是当标准值不能选时，

1222
00:51:47,927 --> 00:51:49,794
Then I usually pick zero.
我一般就选0.

1223
00:51:49,796 --> 00:51:50,761
Okay? If standard value is
如果标准值不可用，

1224
00:51:50,763 --> 00:51:52,495
not an option I'll just make it zero.
我就把它设成0.

1225
00:51:54,699 --> 00:51:56,565
Then here, a line top.
这里，顶部对齐，

1226
00:51:56,567 --> 00:51:58,033
Let's see. Standard value, nope.
选标准值，不行。

1227
00:51:58,035 --> 00:51:58,700
Let's make it zero.
那就是0吧。

1228
00:52:01,905 --> 00:52:02,970
Okay?

1229
00:52:02,972 --> 00:52:04,338
So, no magic numbers there.
魔法数没了。

1230
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,139
How about this guy?
继续下一个。

1231
00:52:05,141 --> 00:52:06,473
Does he have magic numbers?
这个有魔法数吗？

1232
00:52:06,475 --> 00:52:07,907
Yeah, he has this 87.
有一个87.

1233
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:09,909
That's this difference between these two.
这个跟前边的就不同了。

1234
00:52:11,345 --> 00:52:12,377
That's okay.
这个是可以的。

1235
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,845
This has a magic number here.
这里还有一个魔法数。

1236
00:52:13,847 --> 00:52:15,179
This.
这个

1237
00:52:15,181 --> 00:52:16,847
Hello.

1238
00:52:16,849 --> 00:52:21,151
Standard value.
标准值。

1239
00:52:21,153 --> 00:52:22,569
Okay. So now,

1240
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:23,986
the only magic number we have is this 87,
好了，所以现在唯一的魔法数就是这个87了。

1241
00:52:23,989 --> 00:52:25,855
which is this distance here.
是这两个之间的距离。

1242
00:52:25,857 --> 00:52:28,557
Now, what's really cool about this is you can
这里一个非常酷的东西是，

1243
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,826
double click on this.
你可以双击这里。

1244
00:52:30,828 --> 00:52:32,427
And inspect it right in space.
就可以看到它们的间距。

1245
00:52:32,429 --> 00:52:34,462
So here I'm gonna make it be let's say 50.
我要把它设成50.

1246
00:52:34,464 --> 00:52:37,298
So this is a magic number right here, because there's
这是一个魔法数，因为

1247
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,034
really no standard spacing cuz I'm kinda doing somewhat of
这里并没有一个标准的间距，我们正在做的并不是

1248
00:52:40,036 --> 00:52:41,902
a non standard thing here.
一个标准化的东西。

1249
00:52:41,904 --> 00:52:44,371
Any time you do a non standard thing,
每当你要做一个非标准化的东西的时候，

1250
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:47,941
really ask yourself do I really want to be doing this?
都要问一下自己是不是确定。

1251
00:52:47,943 --> 00:52:50,143
Okay cuz I'm kinda going against the grain by doing
要确定自己做的是不是确实需要

1252
00:52:50,145 --> 00:52:54,513
something against, you know, what standard values are.
与标准值不同。

1253
00:52:54,515 --> 00:52:57,516
In this case I'm gonna go ahead and do it, but I should
在这里，我确实需要怎么做，但是

1254
00:52:57,518 --> 00:53:00,452
probably be asking myself if I really wanna do that.
也应该问一下自己是否确定。

1255
00:53:00,454 --> 00:53:01,886
And it might be a little confusing to users.
因为这有可能会让使用者迷惑。

1256
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:03,020
So let's go ahead and
现在咱们继续，

00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,989
look at this thing in the preview again.

1261
00:53:10,995 --> 00:53:14,830
Same thing here, put those in the center, excellent.

1262
00:53:14,832 --> 00:53:15,430
Okay?

1263
00:53:15,432 --> 00:53:16,764

Now, I've got it where I want it.
我觉得已经达到目的了。

1265
00:53:18,868 --> 00:53:21,485
So I can go back and
现在我需要回去

1266
00:53:21,486 --> 00:53:24,103
turn these things back to being non gray, okay?
把这两个辅助视图的灰色去掉，

See how I built that UI?
看到我是怎么构建这个UI的了吗？

1270
00:53:33,413 --> 00:53:35,547
So those spacers, don't forget you can put spacers in.
不要忘了你可以用辅助视图，

1271
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:37,181
They're perfectly legal to throw in there.
把它们扔在那是完全没有问题的。

1272
00:53:37,183 --> 00:53:37,748

00:54:49,678 --> 00:54:54,613
Lets say I'm going to do my viewDidLoad() here, okay, and

1304
00:54:54,615 --> 00:54:57,483
when my view is loaded I'm going to update my UI,、
在我的视图载入的时候更新我的UI。

啊，首先，

1306
00:54:59,369 --> 00:55:01,252
of course, I'm going to do super.viewDidLoad().
我当然需要写 super.viewDidLoad()。

1307
00:55:01,255 --> 00:55:02,387
Then I'm gonna update my UI.
然后我要更新我的UI。

1308
00:55:02,389 --> 00:55:05,490
Gonna make this wider so
把这个弄宽一点，

1309
00:55:05,492 --> 00:55:07,858
this is not jumping out on you so much.
不至于经常换行。

1310
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:11,595
I'm not gonna have a private func here to update my UI.
我这里要实现一个私有方法来更新我的UI。

1311
00:55:11,597 --> 00:55:12,963
And all I'm gonna do in my UI so
目前我要对UI做的事儿是，

1312
00:55:12,965 --> 00:55:16,032
far is, I'm gonna have that password field.
我需要把密码框的

1313
00:55:17,402 --> 00:55:21,203
I'm gonna set its secure text entry to true.
文字加密输入设为真，

1314
00:55:21,205 --> 00:55:23,805
Or actually, I'm gonna set it to secure.
事实上我要设成 secure 。

1315
00:55:23,807 --> 00:55:26,608
And I'm gonna have a var for that.
因为我要有一个变量。

1316
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:29,110
So let's have a var here called secure.
这里写一个叫 secure 的变量。

1317
00:55:30,046 --> 00:55:31,945
It's gonna be boolean.
是布尔类型。

1318
00:55:31,947 --> 00:55:33,580
Actually don't even need to say that.
实际上不需要定义类型，

1319
00:55:33,582 --> 00:55:36,049
Let's say it's false.
给它设为 false 。

1320
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:38,517
It starts out false and I'm gonna do a did set here and
它初始值时false，我要加一个didSet，这样的话，每次它的

1321
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,787
update my UI every time it changes.
值变化的时候就会更新UI。

1322
00:55:40,789 --> 00:55:42,922
And I'm gonna allow this to be public so
我要把它设为公共的，这样

1323
00:55:42,924 --> 00:55:46,425
people can set this boolean secure.
别人就可以设置它的布尔值。

1324
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:49,361
And what's the problem here?
啊，这出什么问题了？

1325
00:55:49,363 --> 00:55:53,231
Oh computer property must have that there's something
哦，计算属性必须。。。好像是哪

1326
00:55:53,233 --> 00:55:54,231
wrong there.
错了。

1327
00:55:54,233 --> 00:55:55,499
Well but that okay.
好了。

1328
00:55:55,501 --> 00:56:00,403
So, I'm going to let people set this secure thing externally, and
这里我允许其他人从外部设置这个值，

1330
00:56:00,405 --> 00:56:04,640
then that's going to change this to say secure password,
然后可以改变这个标签里的文本为 secure password，

1331
00:56:04,642 --> 00:56:08,276
and it's going to start securing it here.
这里也会变成星号。

1332
00:56:08,278 --> 00:56:10,245
So, we're going to do secure text entry.
现在我们看这个文本加密输入，

1333
00:56:10,247 --> 00:56:13,781
This is just a property in UI text field that you can set,
这只是一个你可以设置的UITextField的属性，

1334
00:56:13,783 --> 00:56:15,550
that just makes it so
效果就是

1335
00:56:15,551 --> 00:56:17,318
that when you type, you get the little dots instead of
当是输入的时候，你会看到星号，而不是

1336
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,086
seeing what the person is typing.
明文。

1337
00:56:19,088 --> 00:56:20,620
And then I'm also going to,
下边要做的是，

1338
00:56:20,622 --> 00:56:25,625
in the password label, I'm going to set its text.
密码标签，我要设置它的文本，

1339
00:56:25,627 --> 00:56:29,795
If it's secure, I'm going to set it to be secured password.
如果密码是加密的，我需要让它显示 secured password。

1340
00:56:29,797 --> 00:56:31,880
And if it's not secure,
如果不是，

1341
00:56:31,881 --> 00:56:33,964
I'm going to set it to just be password.
它就显示 password 就好了。

1342
00:56:35,001 --> 00:56:36,000
Okay. So

1343
00:56:36,001 --> 00:56:37,000
that's this label right here.
就是这个标签。

1344
00:56:37,003 --> 00:56:39,737
I'm going to change that label depending on whether
我要根据密码是否为加密输入来改变

1345
00:56:39,739 --> 00:56:40,537
it's secure or not.
它的文本。

1346
00:56:40,539 --> 00:56:43,006
Does that make sense?
明白了吗？

1347
00:56:44,209 --> 00:56:45,975
All right. So let's go ahead and
好，我们继续，

1348
00:56:45,977 --> 00:56:48,110
run because now we need to run,
来运行一下，

1349
00:56:48,112 --> 00:56:51,846
because we're going to be executing our code here.
看看刚才写的代码是不是可以执行。

1350
00:56:53,216 --> 00:56:55,449
Let's hope that when we click that button,
我希望当我摁这个摁钮的时候，

1351
00:56:55,451 --> 00:56:56,784
our autolayout makes it so
我们的自动布局

1352
00:56:56,786 --> 00:56:59,286
that everything kind of shifts over and
会做出相应的位移改变。

1353
00:56:59,288 --> 00:57:02,555
it doesn't because we need to have a target action.
并没有，因为我们还需要一个target action。

1354
00:57:03,891 --> 00:57:06,592
Let's do target action here, we want an action method.
弄一个target action，这里需要一个方法。

1355
00:57:06,594 --> 00:57:09,527
We'll call this toggleSecurity.
我们叫它toggleSecurity。

1356
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,496
Don't need an argument there,、
不需要参数。

1357
00:57:12,498 --> 00:57:14,999
connect, here's toggleSecurity.
点connect，这就是toggleSecurity。

1358
00:57:15,001 --> 00:57:18,435
And this is secure equals not secure.
这里写 secure ＝ !secure

1359
00:57:18,437 --> 00:57:21,271
Okay, we're just gonna toggle the security on that
当我们摁这个摁钮的时候，

1360
00:57:21,273 --> 00:57:22,372
when this button is pressed.
我们需要改变这个布尔值

1361
00:57:22,374 --> 00:57:25,508
[SOUND].

1362
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,042
Okay. So, change security.
好，点这个摁钮。

1363
00:57:27,044 --> 00:57:28,110
Looks good. And see how it

1365
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:32,146
We had equal widths set on these, so
两个输入框是等宽的，

1366
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:33,681
when I changed security it makes these

Okay? Everybody cool with that?
大家都能明白吗？

1392
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:40,167
Okay, what does the User.swift look like?
User.swift 长什么样呢？

1393
00:58:40,169 --> 00:58:42,319
Looks like this.
这样的。

1394
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,470
It's a model class it doesn't has nothing to do with UI.
这是一个model类，跟UI毫无关系。

1395
00:58:44,473 --> 00:58:46,006
It's just model class.
仅仅是一个model类。

1396
00:58:46,008 --> 00:58:48,575
And it just has name, company, login and password.

1397
00:58:48,577 --> 00:58:50,243
And it has a function,

1398
00:58:50,245 --> 00:58:52,912
just a class function here that you can use to log-in.

00:58:57,718 --> 00:59:00,818
Okay. So that's all that's in there.
这就是全部了。

1402
00:59:01,987 --> 00:59:04,921
Let's go use that now, in our controller.
接下来我们要在视图控制器里用它。

1403
00:59:04,923 --> 00:59:07,073
So when I log in,
当我点登陆的时候

1404
00:59:07,074 --> 00:59:09,224
I'm just going to set my set a loggedInUser so I need some
我就需要设置我的 loggedInUser，

1405
00:59:09,227 --> 00:59:13,462
var which is a logged in user, that's basically my model.
所以我要写一个loggedInUser变量，就是我的model。

1406
00:59:13,464 --> 00:59:17,833
LoggedInUser, it's going to be a user.
loggedInUser，user类型。

1407

And I'm going to do the didSet.

1408
00:59:20,337 --> 00:59:22,970
Actually it's going to be user optional.
应该是一个可选变量，

1409
00:59:22,972 --> 00:59:26,040
And I'm going to do my didSet here, and also updateUI.
现在我要写我的didSet，也是 updateUI 。

1410
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:28,942
So if anyone changes my logged in user externally,

1411
00:59:28,944 --> 00:59:32,879
I'll let this be public, then I can update my UI.
这个变量是公共的，然后我可以更新我的UI。

1412
00:59:32,881 --> 00:59:35,715
And finally, say loggedInUser equals User.login.
最后，我要写 loggedInUser ＝ User.login。

1413
00:59:35,717 --> 00:59:38,284
And now I need to give it the login,
现在我要给login参数。

1414
00:59:38,286 --> 00:59:39,852
that's this field right here.
就是输入框里的文本。

1415
00:59:39,854 --> 00:59:43,555
So I'm going to say loginField.text.
所以这里写 loginField.text 。

1416
00:59:44,591 --> 00:59:46,557
But this could be an optional.
这个应该是可选的。

1417
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,858
Okay?

1418
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:50,494
And the user takes a string.
这是一个字符串参数。

1419
00:59:50,496 --> 00:59:53,263
So, I'm gonna say, okay, well, if it's nil, if
所以我这里写，如果它为空，

1420
00:59:53,265 --> 00:59:56,466
the log-in fill is nil, then just pass blank empty string.
如果输入框的文本为空，我就传入一个空字符串。

1421
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:57,534
Okay?

1422
00:59:57,535 --> 00:59:58,601
That's obviously not gonna log into anything,
很明显这样就不会登陆，

1423
00:59:58,603 --> 01:00:00,102
but that's okay.
但是是允许的。

1424
01:00:00,104 --> 01:00:03,205
And then, same thing here; passwordField.text.

1425
01:00:04,408 --> 01:00:08,076
And we'll have empty string there as well, kay?
也需要可选一个空字符串。

1426
01:00:08,078 --> 01:00:09,977
So, that's how we're gonna log in, and
这就是我们如何实现登陆的，

1427
01:00:09,979 --> 01:00:11,512
we'll have a loggedInUser.
通过 loggedInUser 变量。

1428
01:00:11,514 --> 01:00:13,714
Once we have our updateUI here that's,
还需要在 updateUI 里加入，

1429
01:00:13,716 --> 01:00:16,383
actually we'll do that a little later.
这个等一会再做。

1430
01:00:16,385 --> 01:00:17,116
Okay.

1431
01:00:17,118 --> 01:00:19,819
So, that's it, okay?
就先这样。

1432
01:00:19,821 --> 01:00:22,554
So, now we got logged in, we got this whole part of our

1433
01:00:22,556 --> 01:00:24,990
user interface working right here.
用户界面。

1434
01:00:24,992 --> 01:00:26,424

1447
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:58,518
go, but when I click this little thing it says, oh,

the size and vertical position are ambiguous for imageView.
它说这个imageView的尺寸和垂直距离不确定。

1450
01:01:03,858 --> 01:01:05,925
it doesn't know what size it is.

1494
01:02:48,749 --> 01:02:49,313
Oops.
额。。

1495
01:02:51,317 --> 01:02:52,783
There. Update frames.

1496
01:02:52,785 --> 01:02:55,052
Oh, ew, that's no good.
额。这什么情况。 

1497
01:02:55,054 --> 01:02:56,687
Okay.

1498
01:02:56,688 --> 01:02:58,321
So we have a big image there, smashes on top of the other
图片好大，盖住了其他东西。

1499
01:02:58,323 --> 01:03:00,289
thing, so how are we gonna fix that?
我们怎么修复这个问题？

1500
01:03:00,291 --> 01:03:02,725
Well, a simple way to do that would be just to
一个简单的办法就是

1501
01:03:02,727 --> 01:03:06,995
Ctrl+drag between these two and set the vertical spacing.

1502
01:03:06,997 --> 01:03:07,729
Okay? And then I

1503
01:03:07,731 --> 01:03:09,397
can even double click this and

1504
01:03:09,399 --> 01:03:14,001
make this vertical spacing be a standard value.

1505
01:03:14,003 --> 01:03:15,335
Okay? Now, let's go ahead and

1506
01:03:15,337 --> 01:03:17,070
update frames.

1507
01:03:17,072 --> 01:03:18,971
And it doesn't smash into the ones on top.

1508
01:03:20,975 --> 01:03:21,740
Okay?

1509
01:03:21,742 --> 01:03:23,441
Simple solution there.

1510
01:03:23,443 --> 01:03:25,243
But we still have this right here.

1511
01:03:25,245 --> 01:03:27,978
Eight views are vertically ambiguous.

1512
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:29,213
Oh my gosh!

1513
01:03:29,215 --> 01:03:30,180
What did I do?

1514
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:31,314
It looks perfect to me.

1515
01:03:31,316 --> 01:03:32,982
Why is it saying that?

1516
01:03:32,984 --> 01:03:35,751
Well, when you get this kinda thing, it's time to go back to

1517
01:03:35,753 --> 01:03:37,953
our old friend, the document outline here, okay.

1518
01:03:37,955 --> 01:03:40,889
Let's make some more space.

1519
01:03:40,891 --> 01:03:42,657
In the document outline,

1520
01:03:42,659 --> 01:03:45,126
we can click on this thing in the corner here.

1521
01:03:45,128 --> 01:03:46,494
And look at all these problems we have.

1522
01:03:46,496 --> 01:03:49,063
Okay, you can see that it's all these vertical things

1523
01:03:49,065 --> 01:03:51,999
here, understandably, and look what it keeps suggesting.

1524
01:03:52,001 --> 01:03:52,999
Oh, set the vertical

1525
01:03:53,001 --> 01:03:54,701
compression resistance priority.

1526
01:03:54,703 --> 01:03:56,135
Set the vertical hugging.

1527
01:03:56,137 --> 01:03:58,470
What the heck is compression resistance priority and

1528
01:03:58,472 --> 01:03:59,338
vertical hugging?

1529
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,673
What the heck is that?

1530
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:03,675
Okay?

1531
01:04:03,676 --> 01:04:05,676
That has to do with this user interface is going to

1532
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:08,779
be expanding and compressing vertically.

1533
01:04:08,781 --> 01:04:11,515
And when it does, who gets the extra space?

1534
01:04:11,517 --> 01:04:16,152
And when it compresses down, who allows themselves to

1535
01:04:16,154 --> 01:04:18,988
be compressed, and who can't compress?

1536
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:20,256
Okay?

1537
01:04:20,257 --> 01:04:21,523
That's what this hugging and

1538
01:04:21,526 --> 01:04:23,926
compression resistance is about.

1539
01:04:23,928 --> 01:04:28,697
So, here we've got, these guys are all lined up.

1540
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:30,898
This, okay, these two guys, and

1541
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,334
this button, they can not be compressed.

1542
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:34,368
If they get compressed,

1543
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,436
their text is gonna get squished down.

1544
01:04:36,438 --> 01:04:38,405
So, we do not want them compressed.

1545
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,573
But this guy, he could be compressed.

1546
01:04:40,575 --> 01:04:42,442
Because it's an image,

1547
01:04:42,443 --> 01:04:44,310
it can just redraw itself at a shorter height.

1548
01:04:44,312 --> 01:04:48,313
So, I need to set the resistance to being compressed

1549
01:04:48,315 --> 01:04:50,548
for this guy to be lower.

1550
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:52,917
You've got to lower resistance to being compressed.

1551
01:04:52,919 --> 01:04:54,218
So how do I do that?

1552
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:55,753
You do that in the Size Inspector.

1553
01:04:55,755 --> 01:04:58,655
If you select something, you'll see down here at

1554
01:04:58,657 --> 01:05:00,857
the bottom, Content Hugging Priority and

1555
01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:03,693
Content Compression Resistance Priority.

1556
01:05:03,695 --> 01:05:05,061
Okay? Now, these are priorities.

1557
01:05:05,063 --> 01:05:06,695
These are just arbitrary numbers.

1558
01:05:06,697 --> 01:05:10,065
Right now, this one is 750 in the vertical.

1559
01:05:10,067 --> 01:05:12,167
This one is also 750.

1560
01:05:12,169 --> 01:05:13,935
This one is 750.

1561
01:05:13,937 --> 01:05:15,436
This one is 750.

1562
01:05:15,438 --> 01:05:18,205
They all have the same priority to be compressed.

1563
01:05:18,207 --> 01:05:20,707
That's why it's complaining, okay?

1564
01:05:20,709 --> 01:05:23,176
Cuz it doesn't know which one to compress,

1565
01:05:23,178 --> 01:05:24,911
cuz they're all the same.

1566
01:05:24,912 --> 01:05:26,645
So we can just go back to this one and say, okay well,

1567
01:05:26,648 --> 01:05:29,882
we're gonna lower this guy's compression resistance to 700.

1568
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:32,551
Oh, all my problems went away.

1569
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:34,986
Okay? Now I

1570
01:05:34,987 --> 01:05:36,253
have no yellow thing up here.

1571
01:05:36,256 --> 01:05:37,488
This resolved everything.

1572
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:39,023
I had eight things that were ambiguous.

1573
01:05:39,025 --> 01:05:40,290
Now they're all fine.

1574
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:42,158
Why? Because, when we compress now,

1575
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,794
we're gonna know that this is the guy who gets compressed,

1576
01:05:46,931 --> 01:05:47,880
and these guys don't.

1577
01:05:47,881 --> 01:05:48,830
Okay? So that's what the compression

1578
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:51,800
thing, and we'll see hugging in in a second, and com, and

1579
01:05:51,802 --> 01:05:54,469
more compression a little later, okay?

1580
01:05:54,471 --> 01:05:55,403
So that's what these are about.

1581
01:05:55,405 --> 01:05:56,237
A lot of people are, like,

1582
01:05:56,238 --> 01:05:57,070
well, I don't understand these.

1583
01:05:57,073 --> 01:05:57,938
But it's quite simple.

1584
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:59,606
It's just how much is this view,

1585
01:05:59,608 --> 01:06:02,809
compared to other views, resisting being compressed?

1586
01:06:02,811 --> 01:06:04,577
And hugging priority is,

1587
01:06:04,579 --> 01:06:06,712
how much does it want to be its size?

1588
01:06:06,714 --> 01:06:09,014
How much does it want to be small, in other words?

1589
01:06:09,016 --> 01:06:12,484
So, like this guy always, that button always wants to

1590
01:06:12,486 --> 01:06:15,520
be only big enough to hold the login.

1591
01:06:15,522 --> 01:06:18,923
It does not want to be really tall or really wide.

1592
01:06:18,925 --> 01:06:19,990
It wants to hug.

1593
01:06:19,992 --> 01:06:22,226
So, it has a high hugging priority.

1594
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:25,762
Other things, they might not care if they get bigger.

1595
01:06:25,764 --> 01:06:26,713
Okay?

1596
01:06:26,714 --> 01:06:27,663
Like this thing right here,

1597
01:06:27,665 --> 01:06:29,765
it really wants to hug vertically.

1598
01:06:29,767 --> 01:06:32,067
It doesn't mind if it gets stretched out horizontally.

1599
01:06:33,203 --> 01:06:33,768
All right?

1600
01:06:34,971 --> 01:06:35,669
Okay.

1601
01:06:35,671 --> 01:06:37,070
So, that's that.

1602
01:06:37,072 --> 01:06:41,474
Now, let's go to, what are we going to do next here?

1603
01:06:41,476 --> 01:06:44,243
Let's add a couple more fields.

1604
01:06:44,245 --> 01:06:47,012
That name, remember we had the name and the company?

1605
01:06:47,014 --> 01:06:49,181
Let's go add those and see what happens here.

1606
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:52,784
So those are going to be text fields.

1607
01:06:52,786 --> 01:06:54,752
So they're labels rather, they're right here at the top.

1608
01:06:54,754 --> 01:06:56,387
So I'm just going to put these out here,

1609
01:06:56,389 --> 01:06:57,654
grab a couple of these.

1610
01:06:57,656 --> 01:06:59,756
We'll make this one be name.

1611
01:06:59,758 --> 01:07:02,492
We'll make this one be the company.

1612
01:07:02,494 --> 01:07:05,161
All right, now where do I want these to be located?

1613
01:07:05,163 --> 01:07:08,530
Well, I kind of want this to be right here.

1614
01:07:08,532 --> 01:07:11,099
I really want it to be kind of like right here.

1615
01:07:11,101 --> 01:07:13,068
Okay, not perfectly in the middle because I

1616
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,502
am gonna put company right here.

1617
01:07:14,504 --> 01:07:17,371
So now it would be kind of offset down.

1618
01:07:17,373 --> 01:07:19,640
But I guess I can say all right,

1619
01:07:19,642 --> 01:07:21,174
I'll make these two things.

1620
01:07:21,176 --> 01:07:23,476
I'll have their horizontal spacing and

1621
01:07:23,478 --> 01:07:25,445
their Center Y's matched up.

1622
01:07:25,447 --> 01:07:26,579
The centers vertically.

1623
01:07:27,915 --> 01:07:31,049
It's kinda not exactly what I want, but it's close.

1624
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:34,819
And then this guy, I will have his vertical spacing, and

1625
01:07:34,821 --> 01:07:38,089
his left edge lined up with the name.

1626
01:07:38,091 --> 01:07:38,957
Right?

1627
01:07:38,958 --> 01:07:39,824
That's pretty much what I want.

1628
01:07:39,826 --> 01:07:41,358
So that's not bad, but

1629
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,860
really I don't want this lined up with the middle here.

1630
01:07:43,862 --> 01:07:46,730
I want the bottom of this lined up with the middle.

1631
01:07:46,732 --> 01:07:48,064
So how can I do that?

1632
01:07:48,066 --> 01:07:49,432
Okay, pay attention now.

1633
01:07:49,434 --> 01:07:51,066
It's very important to understand, because now

1634
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:53,568
we're gonna start looking at how these constraints work.

1635
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,470
So I'm gonna click on this constraint,

1636
01:07:55,472 --> 01:07:58,773
which causes me to inspect it here in the Inspector.

1637
01:07:58,775 --> 01:07:59,941
Okay? This is

1638
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:01,108
what a constraint looks like.

1639
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:04,111
Notice the constraint has two items, a first item and

1640
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:04,978
a second item.

1641
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:10,917
And, for each item, it says something about that item,

1642
01:08:10,919 --> 01:08:15,654
like its center, or its bottom, or its top.

1643
01:08:15,656 --> 01:08:17,456
Okay? If it had text,

1644
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:19,124
it could be base lines.

1645
01:08:19,126 --> 01:08:20,792
All right?

1646
01:08:20,793 --> 01:08:22,459
So, each of them has something like that.

1647
01:08:22,462 --> 01:08:23,994
And then, it has a relationship between them,

1648
01:08:23,996 --> 01:08:25,929
which could be equal, less than or

1649
01:08:25,931 --> 01:08:28,298
equal, or greater than or equal.

1650
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:31,901
So right now I have the center of this Stanford thing

1651
01:08:31,903 --> 01:08:34,270
equal to the center of the name thing.

1652
01:08:34,272 --> 01:08:38,007
But it's perfectly fine for me to say I want the center of

1653
01:08:38,009 --> 01:08:41,843
the Stanford thing to match the bottom of the name thing.

1654
01:08:41,845 --> 01:08:43,945
Okay?

1655
01:08:43,947 --> 01:08:45,947
Understand that?

1656
01:08:45,949 --> 01:08:48,249
And then, down here you have this constant.

1657
01:08:48,251 --> 01:08:49,200
Okay?

1658
01:08:49,201 --> 01:08:50,150
The constants, there's two constants.

1659
01:08:50,152 --> 01:08:52,319
One is a multiplier, and one is a constant.

1660
01:08:52,321 --> 01:08:54,488
Okay?

1661
01:08:54,489 --> 01:08:56,656
So the constant is always added onto the end,

1662
01:08:56,658 --> 01:08:59,459
and the multiplier is going to multiply the things that

1663
01:08:59,461 --> 01:09:01,127
are being compared.

1664
01:09:01,129 --> 01:09:04,430
So it really doesn't make sense too much to multiply.

1665
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:06,465
But it kind of does.

1666
01:09:06,466 --> 01:09:08,499
Watch if I do four to one ratio.

1667
01:09:08,502 --> 01:09:10,869
It's putting this bottom of this

1668
01:09:12,005 --> 01:09:16,073
the ratio of four to one of the size of here.

1669
01:09:16,075 --> 01:09:16,807
Okay? And

1670
01:09:16,809 --> 01:09:20,276
this can also be like, 0.5.

1671
01:09:20,278 --> 01:09:21,861
Okay.

1672
01:09:21,862 --> 01:09:23,445
Which is really tiny, so tiny that it's one.

1673
01:09:23,448 --> 01:09:24,246
Let's say two.

1674
01:09:25,249 --> 01:09:26,781
All right? So these can be numbers, or

1675
01:09:26,783 --> 01:09:29,000
they can be ratios.

1676
01:09:29,001 --> 01:09:31,218
And then the constant is an amount added to it, like 50.

1677
01:09:31,221 --> 01:09:33,954
Okay, so I've just added fixed 50 pixels.

1678
01:09:33,956 --> 01:09:36,473
So it's just always added.

1679
01:09:36,474 --> 01:09:38,991
So constant is always added, multiplier is multiplied.

1680
01:09:38,994 --> 01:09:42,495
All constraints are this way, every single one.

1681
01:09:42,497 --> 01:09:43,596
Okay? And,

1682
01:09:43,598 --> 01:09:46,132
some make sense with center or top bottom.

1683
01:09:46,134 --> 01:09:48,667
Some of them make sense with width and height.

1684
01:09:48,669 --> 01:09:50,402
And when we do one in code,

1685
01:09:50,403 --> 01:09:52,136
you're gonna see we're gonna do width and height.

1686
01:09:52,139 --> 01:09:55,473
You know, but they're still in the same form.

1687
01:09:55,475 --> 01:09:57,142
They always have the same form.

1688
01:09:57,143 --> 01:09:58,810
That's why there's only one constructor for

1689
01:09:58,812 --> 01:10:00,678
these layout constraint in the code.

1690
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,980
Okay, and it just takes all of these things.

1691
01:10:02,982 --> 01:10:06,149
The constant, the multiplier the first item.

1692
01:10:06,151 --> 01:10:07,250
Which thing on the first item?

1693
01:10:07,252 --> 01:10:08,117
The relationship.

1694
01:10:08,119 --> 01:10:10,086
And the second item, the second, and

1695
01:10:10,088 --> 01:10:12,287
the thing on that, okay?

1696
01:10:12,289 --> 01:10:13,388
So we're gonna see that.

1697
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:15,256
So, lets see if this worked.

1698
01:10:15,258 --> 01:10:18,326
Just for fun let's go ahead and go back to our code, and

1699
01:10:18,328 --> 01:10:19,794
why are these things up.

1700
01:10:21,797 --> 01:10:24,097
Okay, so Ctrl+Drag.

1701
01:10:24,099 --> 01:10:26,466
That's alright, from the name.

1702
01:10:26,468 --> 01:10:29,569
oops, Undo, okay.

1703
01:10:29,571 --> 01:10:31,437
Ctrl+Drag from the name.

1704
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:34,239
That is our Name Label and we'll go and

1705
01:10:34,241 --> 01:10:36,875
Ctrl+Drag from the company here.

1706
01:10:36,877 --> 01:10:39,611
That is our Company Label.

1707
01:10:39,613 --> 01:10:40,311
All right.

1708
01:10:40,313 --> 01:10:41,812
And in our Update UI,

1709
01:10:41,814 --> 01:10:45,349
sorry about the width here, let's do this.

1710
01:10:45,351 --> 01:10:49,786
In our Update UI here, we are going to update those.

1711
01:10:49,788 --> 01:10:54,824
So we'll just say that our Name Label that text,

1712
01:10:54,826 --> 01:10:58,360
equals our logged in user.

1713
01:10:58,362 --> 01:11:00,062
And if our logged in user is nil,

1714
01:11:00,064 --> 01:11:02,530
then we'll just set the text to be nil as well.

1715
01:11:02,532 --> 01:11:04,799
So I'm using optional chaining there.

1716
01:11:04,801 --> 01:11:06,901
But that's the name of the person.

1717
01:11:06,903 --> 01:11:10,871
And then, our company label's text equals the logged in

1718
01:11:10,873 --> 01:11:12,205
user's company.

1719
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:14,774
Okay? Let's also set

1720
01:11:14,776 --> 01:11:16,308
that image view right there.

1721
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:16,875
Okay?

1722
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:20,545
So we'll Ctrl+Drag from the image view

1723
01:11:20,547 --> 01:11:22,113
that's just like any other thing.

1724
01:11:22,115 --> 01:11:24,715
I can Ctrl+Drag this thing over, so let's do that.

1725
01:11:24,717 --> 01:11:27,217
I'm gonna call it the Image View.

1726
01:11:27,219 --> 01:11:29,970
Okay. And

1727
01:11:29,971 --> 01:11:32,722
we'll set that as well in our Update UI.

1728
01:11:32,724 --> 01:11:38,227
Here by saying imageview.image equals the logged in

1729
01:11:38,229 --> 01:11:40,595
user's image.

1730
01:11:40,597 --> 01:11:41,863
Unfortunately, this is not gonna work.

1731
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:44,132
And why is this not gonna work?

1732
01:11:44,134 --> 01:11:47,001
Because Image is not defined in User.

1733
01:11:47,003 --> 01:11:48,168
If we go look at User.

1734
01:11:52,407 --> 01:11:56,442
Okay, user can't have an image because it's a model.

1735
01:11:56,444 --> 01:11:57,810
It doesn't have any UI kit.

1736
01:11:57,812 --> 01:11:58,777
There's no UI.

1737
01:11:58,779 --> 01:12:00,178
And UI image is a UI thing.

1738
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:01,012
Okay.

1739
01:12:01,014 --> 01:12:02,646
So we can't even model.

1740
01:12:02,648 --> 01:12:05,683
But that doesn't stop us from having an image

1741
01:12:05,685 --> 01:12:11,855
property MUser, because we can use extensions.

1742
01:12:11,857 --> 01:12:13,840
Okay.

1743
01:12:13,841 --> 01:12:15,824
So here I'm gonna make an extension to User.

1744
01:12:16,761 --> 01:12:19,128
Okay, it's gonna be a var called image.

1745
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:23,565
It's gonna be a UIImage, UIImage, but I'm adding this

1746
01:12:23,567 --> 01:12:27,135
in my controller so that's fine because, it's extending

1747
01:12:27,137 --> 01:12:29,337
my model but it's not actually touching my model.

1748
01:12:29,339 --> 01:12:32,106
My model is still purely fine.

1749
01:12:32,108 --> 01:12:36,343
And to do this, I'm just gonna return basically a UIImage,

1750
01:12:36,345 --> 01:12:39,479
that is named the user's login.

1751
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:42,515
Now notice, I can refer to login here because this

1752
01:12:42,517 --> 01:12:43,215
is user.

1753
01:12:43,217 --> 01:12:44,683
This is on user, so

1754
01:12:44,685 --> 01:12:49,220
login is a user thing, so I can refer to that, 'kay.

1755
01:12:49,222 --> 01:12:52,656
But this is saying no, because this might return nil.

1756
01:12:52,658 --> 01:12:54,324
So I'm gonna say.

1757
01:12:54,326 --> 01:12:56,426
If I can get let the image equal that,.

1758
01:13:01,399 --> 01:13:03,833
Then, I will return it.

1759
01:13:05,202 --> 01:13:12,107
Otherwise, I will return a UI image of some unknown user.

1760
01:13:12,109 --> 01:13:13,574
I have. A thing there I

1761
01:13:13,576 --> 01:13:15,042
put in there called, unknown user.

1762
01:13:15,044 --> 01:13:17,978
That's just an image that I put there.

1763
01:13:20,449 --> 01:13:23,316
And this, I'm gonna make this optional so

1764
01:13:23,318 --> 01:13:25,851
the whole thing can return optional.

1765
01:13:25,853 --> 01:13:27,353
Okay?

1766
01:13:27,355 --> 01:13:30,355
So now, this is implemented.

1767
01:13:30,357 --> 01:13:31,957
This might return nill but

1768
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:33,558
that's okay, because this is allowed to be nill.

1769
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,492
And all is well.

1770
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:35,977
So let's go take a look,

1771
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:37,461
now we should have our full UI functioning here.

1772
01:13:38,564 --> 01:13:39,896
Let's go on our iPhone here.

1773
01:13:39,898 --> 01:13:47,437
Oh, I know, right here,

1774
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:53,208
okay, run, okay, here it is, so let's log in as madbum.

1775
01:13:54,611 --> 01:13:56,077
And log in, and there we go.

1776
01:13:56,079 --> 01:13:57,612
Oh, that looks terrible.

1777
01:13:59,082 --> 01:14:00,447
What's going on here?

1778
01:14:00,449 --> 01:14:04,718
Look at how it stretched this thing out, okay?

1779
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,886
I want this hugging.

1780
01:14:06,888 --> 01:14:07,586
I don't like this.

1781
01:14:07,588 --> 01:14:09,221
This is not hugging, okay?

1782
01:14:09,223 --> 01:14:10,655
But there's another problem too,

1783
01:14:10,657 --> 01:14:12,374
we'll look at this in a second.

1784
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:14,092
But let's look at it this way, though.

1785
01:14:14,094 --> 01:14:15,426
Same thing, it's no good.

1786
01:14:16,429 --> 01:14:17,795
Okay? So, we're getting close.

1787
01:14:17,797 --> 01:14:19,697
Why is this happening?

1788
01:14:19,698 --> 01:14:21,598
Well, the reason that this is happening is because we have

1789
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,834
all these things attached to each other, and, so

1790
01:14:24,836 --> 01:14:27,103
we can fix this in two ways, actually.

1791
01:14:27,105 --> 01:14:32,408
One way is I can go here, and change this guy,

1792
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:35,310
who's hugging priority can just be less so

1793
01:14:35,312 --> 01:14:37,712
that these guys will be more likely to hug.

1794
01:14:37,714 --> 01:14:38,697
Okay.

1795
01:14:38,698 --> 01:14:39,681
Down on their text.

1796
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:43,084
So I'm gonna set this guy's vertical hugging priority

1797
01:14:43,086 --> 01:14:44,184
down to let's say 200.

1798
01:14:44,186 --> 01:14:47,087
The rest of these are at say, 250.

1799
01:14:47,089 --> 01:14:49,122
Okay, these are all at 250.

1800
01:14:49,124 --> 01:14:51,024
I'm gonna set mine down to 200.

1801
01:14:51,026 --> 01:14:51,824
Okay.

1802
01:14:52,793 --> 01:14:56,361
So we run, let's log in as mad mom again.

1803
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:02,367
There we go, okay, so it didn't squish this,

1804
01:15:02,369 --> 01:15:04,802
although wow, now it's stretched this thing way up.

1805
01:15:04,804 --> 01:15:07,204
I don't really like that either.

1806
01:15:07,206 --> 01:15:07,904
Okay?

1807
01:15:07,906 --> 01:15:09,406
So why is that happening?

1808
01:15:09,408 --> 01:15:12,675
Well that's happening because of this constraint right here.

1809
01:15:12,677 --> 01:15:14,677
This constraint says,

1810
01:15:14,678 --> 01:15:16,678
that the distance from the top of the image to the bottom of

1811
01:15:16,681 --> 01:15:18,914
here has to equal.

1812
01:15:18,916 --> 01:15:20,215
The standard value equal.

1813
01:15:20,217 --> 01:15:22,267
I don't want equal.

1814
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:24,318
I'm gonna say, if it's greater than or equal, that's fine.

1815
01:15:25,722 --> 01:15:27,288
Okay? So this is where you

1816
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:28,855
would use a greater than or equals, because this spacing,

1817
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:31,091
I just want to make sure it doesn't smash into it.

1818
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:32,625
But if it's smaller, that's okay.

1819
01:15:32,627 --> 01:15:33,993
I don't mind that.

1820
01:15:35,963 --> 01:15:36,962
All right. So now, let's try madbum.

1821
01:15:36,964 --> 01:15:37,529
Madbum.

1822
01:15:41,501 --> 01:15:43,534
Okay, perfect, so now it's doing that, and

1823
01:15:43,536 --> 01:15:46,536
over here, oops, over this way, working fine.

1824
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,971
Okay?

1825
01:15:48,973 --> 01:15:50,957
So we're getting good,

1826
01:15:50,958 --> 01:15:52,942
there's only really two things left that are problems in

1827
01:15:52,944 --> 01:15:55,027
this whole thing,

1828
01:15:55,028 --> 01:15:57,111
one is this guy getting smashed off, gotta fix that.

1829
01:15:57,114 --> 01:15:58,447
And we fix that.

1830
01:15:58,449 --> 01:15:59,614
You already know how to fix that.

1831
01:15:59,616 --> 01:16:01,549
I'm just gonna take this, and make it so

1832
01:16:01,551 --> 01:16:04,452
that this thing hooks to this edge.

1833
01:16:04,454 --> 01:16:08,088
And same thing with this thing hooking to this guy's edge.

1834
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:11,224
And again, I don't want them to be anything but

1835
01:16:11,226 --> 01:16:12,392
a standard value here.

1836
01:16:12,394 --> 01:16:14,193
So I'm gonna have this one be zero.

1837
01:16:16,397 --> 01:16:17,963
And same thing with this one right here.

1838
01:16:17,965 --> 01:16:19,264
I don't like this.

1839
01:16:20,633 --> 01:16:21,565
Nonstandard values.

1840
01:16:21,567 --> 01:16:23,767
In fact, I've got a couple of them

1841
01:16:23,768 --> 01:16:25,968
left over from previous things here, so let's fix these.

1842
01:16:25,971 --> 01:16:29,506
Standard Values.

1843
01:16:29,508 --> 01:16:30,506
Okay?

1844
01:16:30,508 --> 01:16:31,574
All right.

1845
01:16:31,576 --> 01:16:32,641
Everything look good there?

1846
01:16:32,643 --> 01:16:33,408
No magic numbers?

1847
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:34,275
Oh, here's the magic number.

1848
01:16:34,277 --> 01:16:35,009
Let's get rid of that.

1849
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:37,745
Standard Value.

1850
01:16:39,148 --> 01:16:41,548
That it, okay, got all those.

1851
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:43,216
Everything looks fine, it moved.

1852
01:16:43,218 --> 01:16:45,317
So now, we should be all fixed and ready to go.

1853
01:16:45,319 --> 01:16:50,022
Alright, madbum again.

1854
01:16:50,024 --> 01:16:52,791
Secure this time, don't want you to know madbum's password.

1855
01:16:53,993 --> 01:16:56,761
Okay, looking good, oh, still didn't quite work.

1856
01:16:56,763 --> 01:17:00,697
We got the name but why did this thing.

1857
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:01,798
Not do that.

1858
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:02,865
What's going on there?

1859
01:17:02,867 --> 01:17:04,266
Same circle Giants got put up.

1860
01:17:04,268 --> 01:17:08,270
The reason there is this guy's hogging priority is too

1861
01:17:08,272 --> 01:17:10,638
low, okay.

1862
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,373
I'm sorry, his compression resistance, I mean,

1863
01:17:12,375 --> 01:17:14,075
is too low.

1864
01:17:14,076 --> 01:17:15,776
He's allowing himself to be compressed.

1865
01:17:15,778 --> 01:17:17,111
Okay.

1866
01:17:17,112 --> 01:17:18,445
So here, we need to have the horizontal compression

1867
01:17:18,447 --> 01:17:20,247
resistance of this guy be higher.

1868
01:17:20,249 --> 01:17:21,381
So I'm gonna set it to 800.

1869
01:17:21,383 --> 01:17:22,882
Doesn't really matter what we set,

1870
01:17:22,884 --> 01:17:24,216
as long as it's higher than.

1871
01:17:24,218 --> 01:17:27,119
The other things, like this one, which is 750, so

1872
01:17:27,121 --> 01:17:31,990
let's set this guy's also, oops, it's compression to 800.

1873
01:17:31,992 --> 01:17:35,926
Okay, so that prevents them from being compressed down so

1874
01:17:35,928 --> 01:17:37,528
that their text won't show.

1875
01:17:37,530 --> 01:17:40,130
Okay.

1876
01:17:40,132 --> 01:17:46,235
Oh, well, that's not so good.

1877
01:17:46,237 --> 01:17:49,138
Okay, so we fixed one problem, we introduces another one.

1878
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:50,807
So we certainly-

1879
01:17:50,808 --> 01:17:52,475
There are two problems with this,

1880
01:17:52,476 --> 01:17:54,143
actually, number one, this is not the right aspect ratio.

1881
01:17:54,145 --> 01:17:55,610
This is not what the Giants logo looks like,

1882
01:17:55,612 --> 01:17:57,245
you can barely even tell it's the Giants.

1883
01:17:57,247 --> 01:18:00,481
And number two is, it's way too small, okay?

1884
01:18:00,483 --> 01:18:03,784
Look at all this empty space I've got up here, okay, so

1885
01:18:03,786 --> 01:18:05,085
we've got two things to fix here.

1886
01:18:05,087 --> 01:18:06,787
And then we're done.

1887
01:18:06,789 --> 01:18:09,889
One is make this aspect ratio be enforced, and

1888
01:18:09,891 --> 01:18:13,026
another one is put this in the right space.

1889
01:18:13,028 --> 01:18:16,595
In this size class which is I got a lot of vertical space.

1890
01:18:16,597 --> 01:18:20,198
So, lets go ahead and fix the aspect ratio one first.

1891
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,867
You know that one.

1892
01:18:22,869 --> 01:18:25,236
We'd like to be able to just go here and

1893
01:18:25,238 --> 01:18:27,805
add some kind of constraint, but we can't actually do that.

1894
01:18:27,807 --> 01:18:30,708
And that's because if you remember, when we look

1895
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:35,845
at a constraint, its constant and multiplier are constants.

1896
01:18:35,847 --> 01:18:38,348
And every time we get a new image,

1897
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:40,216
it has a different aspect ratio.

1898
01:18:41,318 --> 01:18:42,718
Okay?

1899
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,119
So, unless we wanted to force everyone's image to

1900
01:18:44,121 --> 01:18:46,788
be the same aspect ratio, we need code to

1901
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:49,791
do this because we have to calculate that aspect ratio.

1902
01:18:49,793 --> 01:18:50,858
So, this is what that looks like.

1903
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:53,027
I'm gonna go through this pretty fast because

1904
01:18:53,029 --> 01:18:56,730
we're over time already, so you can watch it here.

1905
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:58,765
So, I'm gonna do this like this.

1906
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:00,400
I'm gonna create a new var,

1907
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:04,503
which is an aspectRatioConstraint(), and

1908
01:19:04,505 --> 01:19:07,706
it's going to be of type NSLayoutConstraint.

1909
01:19:07,708 --> 01:19:10,575
This is the type of those constraints.

1910
01:19:10,577 --> 01:19:13,845
All those constraints in there it is of this type, okay.

1911
01:19:13,847 --> 01:19:17,448
Now, I'm gonna create another var called image, UIImage.

1912
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:21,851
And it can be optional, it's fine.

1913
01:19:21,853 --> 01:19:24,253
And it's just gonna be a computed property,

1914
01:19:24,255 --> 01:19:28,424
where I'm gonna get and set my image views properties.

1915
01:19:28,426 --> 01:19:31,126
So I'm really just gonna return imageView.image,

1916
01:19:31,128 --> 01:19:32,327
I'm gonna set her.

1917
01:19:32,329 --> 01:19:33,594
I'm just going to set it.

1918
01:19:33,596 --> 01:19:35,896
Let's go to wide here.

1919
01:19:35,898 --> 01:19:37,965
Wide mode.

1920
01:19:41,203 --> 01:19:42,435
Okay, in the center,

1921
01:19:42,437 --> 01:19:45,238
I'm just gonna set it imageView.image = image.

1922
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,873
Now, why am I creating this little computer property?

1923
01:19:47,875 --> 01:19:51,443
Because every time I set my imageView's image I

1924
01:19:51,445 --> 01:19:55,547
want to update this aspect ration constraint, okay.

1925
01:19:55,549 --> 01:19:58,082
So, if I can let this constrained view,

1926
01:19:58,084 --> 01:20:00,785
this is the view I'm trying to constrain,

1927
01:20:00,787 --> 01:20:02,353
which is the image view.

1928
01:20:02,355 --> 01:20:04,054
If I can let it equal something.

1929
01:20:04,056 --> 01:20:07,590
In other words it's not nill, okay?

1930
01:20:07,592 --> 01:20:12,161
And if I can let the new image equal new value,

1931
01:20:12,163 --> 01:20:14,563
because this is, we're setting an image here, so

1932
01:20:14,565 --> 01:20:18,800
if I'm able to set an image in this constraint, screen view.

1933
01:20:18,802 --> 01:20:20,168
Then I'm gonna create this

1934
01:20:20,170 --> 01:20:22,436
aspectRatioConstraint equal to something.

1935
01:20:22,438 --> 01:20:24,605
If I can't set the new image, then I'm gonna

1936
01:20:24,607 --> 01:20:29,409
set the aspectRatioContraint equal to nil, 'kay.

1937
01:20:29,411 --> 01:20:31,644
So someone set my image to nil.

1938
01:20:31,646 --> 01:20:32,945
I can't have a constraint.

1939
01:20:32,947 --> 01:20:35,647
The aspect ration of nil image is nothing, so I don't,

1940
01:20:35,649 --> 01:20:37,849
can't even have a constraint there.

1941
01:20:37,851 --> 01:20:39,684
So how do I create this constraint in the case I

1942
01:20:39,686 --> 01:20:41,419
do have an image for imageView?

1943
01:20:41,421 --> 01:20:43,220
I just do it with a constructor,

1944
01:20:43,222 --> 01:20:45,556
NSLayoutConstraint, okay?

1945
01:20:45,558 --> 01:20:47,024
Here's what NSLayoutConstraint's

1946
01:20:47,026 --> 01:20:48,058
constructor looks like.

1947
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,592
It's got all these things here,

1948
01:20:49,594 --> 01:20:52,061
let's go through them one at a time, and

1949
01:20:52,063 --> 01:20:54,863
it looks just like that inspector I showed you.

1950
01:20:54,865 --> 01:20:59,067
So one is the thing we're trying to constrain.

1951
01:20:59,069 --> 01:21:03,404
Which is our image view, what attribute of that, it's width,

1952
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:08,742
how do we want to relate it to our constants and multipliers?

1953
01:21:08,744 --> 01:21:10,343
Well, we're going to do aspect ratio, so

1954
01:21:10,345 --> 01:21:12,979
we want the width multiplied times the height.

1955
01:21:12,981 --> 01:21:17,616
So the width is going to equal the height times the aspect

1956
01:21:17,618 --> 01:21:19,551
ratio, so this is going to be equal.

1957
01:21:20,587 --> 01:21:22,053
And what are we relating it to?

1958
01:21:22,055 --> 01:21:24,121
We could relate it to another thing, but

1959
01:21:24,123 --> 01:21:27,057
this is the imageviews own aspect ratio, so it's relating

1960
01:21:27,059 --> 01:21:31,661
it to itself, okay, and what attribute is it relating to?

1961
01:21:31,663 --> 01:21:35,365
It's height, and what is the multiplier going to be?

1962
01:21:35,367 --> 01:21:39,168
It's going to be that new image aspect ratio.

1963
01:21:40,404 --> 01:21:42,504
Okay? And then this constant gets

1964
01:21:42,506 --> 01:21:43,438
added in.

1965
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,805
We don't want to add anything else in.

1966
01:21:44,807 --> 01:21:46,073
We just want to multiply.

1967
01:21:46,075 --> 01:21:49,643
So here I'm making this image view's width equal to it's

1968
01:21:49,645 --> 01:21:51,411
height times this multiplier.

1969
01:21:52,814 --> 01:21:54,030
Make sense?

1970
01:21:54,031 --> 01:21:55,247
That's the constraint I'm putting on it.

1971
01:21:55,249 --> 01:21:56,281
That's how constraints work.

1972
01:21:56,283 --> 01:21:57,366
That's all it is.

1973
01:21:57,367 --> 01:21:58,450
Now a couple of things are not good here.

1974
01:21:58,452 --> 01:22:02,087
One is there is no such method aspect ratio on UI image.

1975
01:22:02,089 --> 01:22:04,622
So I'm gonna go down here and do an extension for that too.

1976
01:22:05,558 --> 01:22:10,727
UIImage var aspectRatio.

1977
01:22:10,729 --> 01:22:12,195
It's gonna be a CGFloat.

1978
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:16,565
I'm just going to return if my size.height is not zero,

1979
01:22:16,567 --> 01:22:20,069
because I don't wanna have to divide by zero.

1980
01:22:20,071 --> 01:22:23,005
Then I'm going to return size.width divided by

1981
01:22:23,007 --> 01:22:26,675
size.height, otherwise I guess I'll just return zero.

1982
01:22:26,677 --> 01:22:30,378
Okay, so I just added this var to UI image,

1983
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:32,463
because I wanted it and

1984
01:22:32,464 --> 01:22:34,547
it makes my code read really nicely right here, okay?

1985
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:36,850
Perfectly reasonable.

1986
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:39,151
And the only other thing is, when I set this aspect ratio

1987
01:22:39,154 --> 01:22:42,589
constraint I'm creating it, but now I need to enforce it.

1988
01:22:42,591 --> 01:22:45,058
So how do you enforce a constraint?

1989
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,226
If you have one in your hand, how do you force it?

1990
01:22:47,228 --> 01:22:48,594
And it's very simple,

1991
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:51,697
you just add it as a constraint to the view.

1992
01:22:51,699 --> 01:22:53,031
So I'm in my view controller here, so

1993
01:22:53,033 --> 01:22:57,335
I'm going to add this constraint to my view.

1994
01:22:57,337 --> 01:23:00,971
So in didSet, any time this aspect ratio gets set up here,

1995
01:23:00,973 --> 01:23:02,138
this is where I set it.

1996
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:03,106
Either to nil or this.

1997
01:23:04,242 --> 01:23:07,976
Then if I can let this new

1998
01:23:07,978 --> 01:23:11,813
constraint equal the aspect ratio of constraint.

1999
01:23:11,815 --> 01:23:13,581
In other words, if its not nil.

2000
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:16,884
Then I'm gonna tell my view please add this constraint.

2001
01:23:20,122 --> 01:23:23,490
Now I also, by the way, when it set I want to

2002
01:23:23,492 --> 01:23:26,793
remove any old constraint cause I might already have

2003
01:23:26,795 --> 01:23:29,328
put a constraint from the previous image I was showing.

2004
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:33,099
So I'm gonna say if let the existing constraint

2005
01:23:33,101 --> 01:23:34,867
equal the aspect ratio constraint and

2006
01:23:34,869 --> 01:23:38,636
this is my will set so this hasn't been set yet.

2007
01:23:39,606 --> 01:23:41,538
Then I'm gonna say remove the constraint.

2008
01:23:44,343 --> 01:23:46,710
Make sense? So that's it.

2009
01:23:46,712 --> 01:23:49,278
Okay, and that's all we need to do.

2010
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,180
So let's go ahead and run here.

2011
01:23:51,182 --> 01:23:53,615
So I'm going to go back to this view here,

2012
01:23:53,617 --> 01:23:55,884
and select Storyboard here.

2013
01:23:55,886 --> 01:23:57,719
All right, so we're going to run this.

2014
01:23:57,721 --> 01:23:59,454
I haven't changed the storyboard since last we

2015
01:23:59,456 --> 01:24:02,756
talked, but now when we go madbomb here.

2016
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:07,660
This thing, it didn't work.

2017
01:24:07,662 --> 01:24:09,696
So why does this not work?

2018
01:24:09,698 --> 01:24:12,465
because, sorry about this, forgot something.

2019
01:24:12,467 --> 01:24:17,102
When I set my image, I'm not calling my new image property.

2020
01:24:17,104 --> 01:24:20,838
I put all that nice code here inside this image

2021
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:23,174
property, right?

2022
01:24:23,176 --> 01:24:24,274
Right here.

2023
01:24:24,276 --> 01:24:25,909
But I didn't call it.

2024
01:24:25,911 --> 01:24:28,144
So here I'm actually calling that, so sorry about that.

2025
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:32,314
Why did I [INAUDIBLE] there, imageView.image equals

2026
01:24:32,316 --> 01:24:35,384
newValue, sorry about that, newValue.

2027
01:24:35,386 --> 01:24:39,554
Let's go back here, all right.

2028
01:24:39,556 --> 01:24:43,457
See, when I rush, then I make mistakes like that.

2029
01:24:43,459 --> 01:24:44,258
Okay, all right!

2030
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:44,825
Whoo.

2031
01:24:45,927 --> 01:24:48,361
I think that's the Giants logo down there.

2032
01:24:48,363 --> 01:24:50,329
At least it's the right aspect ratio.

2033
01:24:50,331 --> 01:24:52,498
But clearly, it's terrible to have that thing there

2034
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,533
because it's too tiny and we got all this space.

2035
01:24:54,535 --> 01:24:57,035
So last thing we're going to do is

2036
01:24:57,036 --> 01:24:59,536
use the size classes to put this thing up here, okay?

2037
01:24:59,539 --> 01:25:00,738
How do we do that?

2038
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:03,774
We go back to our storyboard right here.

2039
01:25:03,776 --> 01:25:04,875
And right now, we've been doing all our

2040
01:25:04,877 --> 01:25:07,210
work in this any any.

2041
01:25:07,212 --> 01:25:10,613
Okay, and what we want to do is when we're regular height,

2042
01:25:10,615 --> 01:25:13,182
we're gonna put the name and the company underneath.

2043
01:25:13,184 --> 01:25:17,419
So I'm gonna go here to where it says any width,

2044
01:25:17,421 --> 01:25:18,904
regular height.

2045
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:20,388
You see where it says along the top, any width,

2046
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:21,089
regular height.

2047
01:25:21,091 --> 01:25:21,989
See that?

2048
01:25:21,991 --> 01:25:23,657
I'm gonna click there.

2049
01:25:23,659 --> 01:25:25,025
Now I'm editing.

2050
01:25:25,026 --> 01:25:26,392
You see the bar at the bottom is bright blue.

2051
01:25:26,395 --> 01:25:28,462
That's to remind you,

2052
01:25:28,463 --> 01:25:30,530
oh hey, you are editing a specific size class here.

2053
01:25:30,532 --> 01:25:33,299
But we're editing any width, regular height.

2054
01:25:33,301 --> 01:25:36,469
And so here, this should be in red if I

2055
01:25:36,471 --> 01:25:39,838
was doing a slide, this would be in red, which is

2056
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,607
when you go to another size class, and you're going to be

2057
01:25:42,609 --> 01:25:45,510
moving things around, remove the constraints on

2058
01:25:45,512 --> 01:25:49,147
the things you're going to be moving before you move them.

2059
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:50,799
Because once you start moving them,

2060
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,450
it's going to be hard to remember, what did that go to.

2061
01:25:52,452 --> 01:25:54,651
So here I am selecting these all and

2062
01:25:54,653 --> 01:25:58,488
I am going to go over here and remove the constraint,

2063
01:25:58,490 --> 01:26:00,757
clear the constraints, only from the selected views,

2064
01:26:00,759 --> 01:26:01,991
these three things I have selected.

2065
01:26:01,993 --> 01:26:03,826
So we're going to clear those constraints,

2066
01:26:03,828 --> 01:26:05,494
now they have no constraints,

2067
01:26:05,496 --> 01:26:07,496
now I am just going to move them around to where I want.

2068
01:26:07,498 --> 01:26:09,130
So I want that one there,

2069
01:26:09,132 --> 01:26:11,399
I want these down here at the bottom.

2070
01:26:11,401 --> 01:26:12,366
Put that in the corner.

2071
01:26:12,368 --> 01:26:13,701
I'll put that on top of there.

2072
01:26:13,703 --> 01:26:15,769
We'll put this down here like that.

2073
01:26:15,771 --> 01:26:17,604
Now we'll put the new constraints, so

2074
01:26:17,606 --> 01:26:20,206
now all new constraints that I'm making are only for

2075
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:22,008
this size class.

2076
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,542
Okay? Not for any-any anymore.

2077
01:26:23,544 --> 01:26:25,544
I'm kind of forked off here.

2078
01:26:25,546 --> 01:26:27,946
So let's put some new constraints on here.

2079
01:26:27,948 --> 01:26:29,547
This one is leaving space.

2080
01:26:29,549 --> 01:26:31,449
This one is leading space.

2081
01:26:31,451 --> 01:26:34,018
This one is bottom space.

2082
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:35,819
We want these separated.

2083
01:26:35,821 --> 01:26:36,653
Vertical space.

2084
01:26:36,655 --> 01:26:38,888
We want these two separated.

2085
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:41,657
We want this one over here leading space.

2086
01:26:41,659 --> 01:26:45,160
We want this to go all the way across, and

2087
01:26:45,162 --> 01:26:47,029
then go trailing space.

2088
01:26:47,031 --> 01:26:51,199
You also want this one to go all the way across, and

2089
01:26:51,201 --> 01:26:52,166
trailing space.

2090
01:26:53,269 --> 01:26:54,101
Okay.

2091
01:26:54,103 --> 01:26:55,769
Again, we would probably go here.

2092
01:26:55,771 --> 01:26:57,403
Let's see what we've got here.

2093
01:26:57,405 --> 01:26:58,738
Frames are different, that's good.

2094
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:01,039
Let's go ahead and update our frames.

2095
01:27:02,476 --> 01:27:03,675
Okay, looks good.

2096
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:05,677
All looks good.

2097
01:27:05,678 --> 01:27:07,678
Again, we would probably get rid of these magic numbers

2098
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:08,245
like this.

2099
01:27:08,247 --> 01:27:09,046
We don't like that.

2100
01:27:09,048 --> 01:27:09,879
We get rid of that.

2101
01:27:09,881 --> 01:27:11,280
We did this one.

2102
01:27:11,282 --> 01:27:12,581
We don't like that.

2103
01:27:12,583 --> 01:27:14,917
We go select on this guy.

2104
01:27:14,919 --> 01:27:19,287
We've got this here, that.

2105
01:27:19,289 --> 01:27:20,421
Same thing this one.

2106
01:27:20,423 --> 01:27:21,589
Okay, he got none, so we're good.

2107
01:27:21,591 --> 01:27:22,489
We're good to go.

2108
01:27:22,491 --> 01:27:25,225
So now we've created this size class.

2109
01:27:25,227 --> 01:27:28,828
One has different arrangement of views and

2110
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:29,995
different constraints.

2111
01:27:29,997 --> 01:27:30,963
So now when we run.

2112
01:27:33,133 --> 01:27:33,832
We'll see here.

2113
01:27:34,868 --> 01:27:35,733
Hit mad bum again.

2114
01:27:37,570 --> 01:27:38,602
There it is.

2115
01:27:38,603 --> 01:27:39,635
It's using this space much more

2116
01:27:39,638 --> 01:27:42,739
effectively keeping this in it's normal aspect ratio, but

2117
01:27:42,741 --> 01:27:44,874
in this way it goes back to the old way.

2118
01:27:44,876 --> 01:27:47,843
The any, any way, right?

2119
01:27:47,845 --> 01:27:50,312
Okay, and this is true if we go to someone else.

2120
01:27:50,314 --> 01:27:51,880
Hennessy.

2121
01:27:51,882 --> 01:27:55,250
There, okay, see how that keeps the same aspect ratio

2122
01:27:55,252 --> 01:27:56,884
and uses that space?

2123
01:27:56,886 --> 01:27:58,953
Really uses the space nicely here, no.

2124
01:27:58,955 --> 01:28:00,421
>> [LAUGH]

2125
01:28:00,423 --> 01:28:02,756
>> Now why did that happen, okay?

2126
01:28:02,758 --> 01:28:05,692
Because when I cleared the constraints here,

2127
01:28:05,694 --> 01:28:10,296
okay, to make this new space, I also cleared this little

2128
01:28:10,298 --> 01:28:13,665
constraint that went up here, this vertical spacing.

2129
01:28:13,667 --> 01:28:15,550
Right?

2130
01:28:15,551 --> 01:28:17,434
This vertical spacing here wants to be the greater than

2131
01:28:17,437 --> 01:28:20,171
or equal to, and standard value.

2132
01:28:20,173 --> 01:28:21,505
Okay? So sometimes when you

2133
01:28:21,507 --> 01:28:24,174
go to another size class, you delete the constraints,

2134
01:28:24,176 --> 01:28:26,076
you move things around, oh, you still have

2135
01:28:26,078 --> 01:28:29,446
to basically debug the new one just as much as the old one.

2136
01:28:29,448 --> 01:28:31,548
So here now,

2137
01:28:31,549 --> 01:28:33,649
let's go see if our illustrious leader's log in.

2138
01:28:35,419 --> 01:28:36,385
It's good and it is.

2139
01:28:38,155 --> 01:28:38,720
Okay?

2140
01:28:39,889 --> 01:28:40,938
All right.

2141
01:28:40,939 --> 01:28:41,988
Sorry to take so long.

2142
01:28:41,991 --> 01:28:43,757
Thank you.

2143
01:28:43,758 --> 01:28:45,524
I'll be here if you have any questions,

2144
01:28:45,527 --> 01:28:46,926
otherwise I'll see you on Wednesday.

2145
